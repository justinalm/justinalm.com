<p class="work-content">Fashion retail can appear superficial, ineffectual, cold, and void of genuine relationships. To combat this sentiment, I worked with Hans Woo defining an identity for her Vancouver based fashion company, Woo To See You. I sought to transform potentially banal items into objects of joy. Woo To See You <em>is</em> fun with fashion and is set in a store for people who love clothing. Retail <em>is</em> relationships and people should feel <em>good</em> when they say “Woo To See You”.</p>
