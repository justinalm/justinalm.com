<p>As a user experience designer at Jostle Corporation, my work involves strategy, information architecture, wire-framing, visual design of user interfaces for desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

<p>As an interface designer at Steamclock Software, my work involved strategy, information architecture, wire-framing, visual design of user interfaces, and the design and production of marketing materials of various formats. Half of my time at Steamclock was spent designing the products WeddingDJ and PartyMonster. The other half of my time was spent on consulting and design.</p>

<h3 id="contract-designer--free-agency-creative">Contract Designer – Free Agency Creative</h3>

<p>I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for Nintendo of America, large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for Park Royal Shopping Centre, advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver’s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for Marketplace Events – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.</p>

<h3 id="interaction-designer--emily-carr-university-of-art--design">Interaction Designer – Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design</h3>

<p><sup><em>Feb. 2012 — Apr. 2012</em></sup></p>

<p>I designed the website for The 2012 Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue and managed the deployment of the site to Emily Carr’s server. Working with a team of students handing visual identity of the exhibition, I presented concepts, prototypes, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, throughout the design and production of the catalogue and website. The website was designed to make student work easily accessible on any device and across all major browsers.</p>

<h3 id="research-assistant--emily-carr-university-of-art--design">Research Assistant – Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design</h3>

<h3 id="interaction-designer--emily-carr-university-of-art--design--mozilla">Interaction Designer – Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design &amp; Mozilla</h3>

<p><sup><em>Mar. — Sept. 2011</em></sup></p>

<p>I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who investigated technology options for creating an ebook, Learning, Freedom and the Web. We built an ebook for tablets, and desktop computers, and that is distributed for free. We designed it to take advantage of the navigation and multimedia opportunities a tablet could provide. Working with Vancouver-based development company Steamclock Software, our team built the book in HTML5, Javascript and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations"><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</h2>

<p>“Justin is a talented designer who consistently demonstrates a high level of knowledge, skill and commitment in his work.”</p>

<p><sup><em>– Sandra Dametto, Project Manager, S3D Centre &amp; SIM Centre</em></sup></p>

<p>“It’s been a pleasure working with Justin. He’s proved himself highly adaptable, tackling a wide variety of tasks across web and apps, digital and print, internally and for clients. He challenged us to level up our design process, while also engaging in the more technical side of the business. I’m excited to see his future success as he takes on more leadership and tackles new challenges.”</p>

<p><sup><em>– Allen Pike, Co-founder, Steamclock Software</em></sup></p>

<p>“Justin Alm is one of those rare designers who is just as concerned with the functionality of a website as he is with it’s form, and has the talents and experience to fully deliver both. He is able to produce innovative web design while working within the project’s limitations and deadlines. He is a delight to work with, and I hope to one day be fortunate enough to work with him again.”</p>

<p><sup><em>– Alley Kurgan, Designer &amp; Photographer</em></sup></p>

<p>“Justin and I worked together on a variety of projects at Steamclock Software. Justin is an extremely talented individual who is full of creative energy. We’ve had many fantastic coffee fuelled brainstorming sessions which always left me feeling invigorated and confident that our project was headed in the right direction. He’s a great person to work with and I hope I get the chance to collaborate with him again in the future.”</p>

<p><sup><em>– Robert MacEachern, Mobile Software Engineer, Steamclock Software</em></sup></p>

<p>“I have learned much from working with Justin, and he showed me what being a designer is really all about. Not only is Justin incredible with both hand-drawn and digital design, he is also a proficient web developer. Furthermore, Justin’s insight and thorough understanding of iOS and Android design patterns have helped us created many awesome products.”</p>

<p><sup><em>– Jeremy Chiang, iOS &amp; Android Developer, Steamclock Software</em></sup></p>

<h2 id="education"><strong>Education</strong>:</h2>

<h3 id="emily-carr-university-of-art--design--bdes--interaction-design">Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design – B.Des — Interaction Design</h3>

<p><sup><em>2008 — 2012</em></sup></p>

<p>The Interaction Design Degree Program taught me the iterative process of design. From writing proposals, concept development, visual research and exploration, user-testing, refining designs and development, and finishing projects for implementation or delivery, I’ve been educated to embrace the tension found in the convergent and divergent plot structure we find in the narrative of every design project.</p>
