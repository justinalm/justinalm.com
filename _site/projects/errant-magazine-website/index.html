<p><em>UX/UI, Front-end, WordPress</em></p>

<p><a href="http://greyvy.com/">Grey Vaisius</a> and I designed and developed the website for <a href="http://www.errantmagazine.ca/">Errant Magazine</a>. We made wireframes, visual designs, prototypes, and built a WordPress theme for publishing long-form articles, photo essays, and poetry. We included a reference manual.</p>
