        	<p>I’m not sure what to make of Snapchat’s recent rejection of Facebook’s $3 billion dollar offer. What kind of a company turns down an offer for 3 billion? This news sparked some discussion amongst the team at Steamclock Software. You have to respect a company that isn’t interested in selling and I’m assuming <em>pride in product</em> is what motivated Snapchat to look at all of those zeros and say, “no”. On the otherhand, I feel like if you had one good idea for an app there must be other apps you’d like to work on. It’s not like $3 billion wouldn’t give you and everyone in the company the money to get another product up and running – with the most badass design, development, and marketing campaign. Is time-limited photo sharing that important for the world? Maybe the thought of all that money made the Snapchat team feel a tinge of depression. There would be no more struggle. No more worry about success. No more tension of building and maintaining a product. We can all do the math and see the interest on that cake would print money.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I gave Snapchat a test ride but eventually lost interest. My first impression was that the UI was goofy and bad (in a good way). It’s refreshing to use a piece of software that doesn’t take itself seriously. Everything about the company seems <em>bad to be good</em>. What’s with the clown colours, the fat ghost icon, wrapping paper background patterns, the cartoon camera button, the gridless time picker? I’m not saying I don’t like it but I feel like this is definitely <em>design for delight</em>. Wacky, sarcastic, hipster, teen dazed delight.</p>

<p>In the end, I felt like it was another social network I had to invest in to get value out of. How do I invest with fleeting moments? After loosing my spark to snap and chat, I eventually stopped opening the app, it was dumped it in my collection of apps I never used, and then deleted during a purge. After Facebook’s offer, I felt like I had to go back and see what makes this product worth a $3 billion offer. I’m still wondering…</p>

<p>During my vacation, I built a fitting room at the <a href='http://www.wootoseeyou.com'>Woo To See You Boutique</a>, went for a hike up the <a href='http://lynncanyon.ca/'>Lynn Valley Canyon</a>, drove a <a href='http://www.zipcar.com/'>ZipCar</a> for the first time(Mini), and made almost daily trips to <a href='http://www.jjbeancoffee.com/our-locations/yaletown/'>JJ Bean Yaletown</a> for cappucinos, coding, and design. I’m the type of person that likes to use holidays for personal work.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I sat down to work on this website and <a href='http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac'>CleanMyMac</a> popped up on my screen. I had free time to run a scan and delete the cruft from <a href='http://www.apple.com/ca/osx/'>Mavericks</a>. This was a bad idea. Application and document icons disappeared from Finder. App Store, Contacts, Calendar, and Messages ceased to open. They would bounce once or twice, the highlight would appear in the Dock, but the application frame wouldn’t open. Interestingly, the Chrome icon was the only icon to disappeared from the Dock. After digging around on Google, I learned my old version of CleanMyMac was the culprit and <a href='http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac'>CleanMyMac 2</a> won’t criple your Mavericks.</p>

        	<p>I just finished reading <a href='http://martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html'>Martin Majoor’s philosophy of typeface design</a>. Woven into the philosophical basis for his work is an in-depth explanation of serif and sans-serif typeface design. This is a great read for anyone interested in why sans-serif type looks the way it does. Majoor reminded me about the benefits of working in a <em>free</em> environment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…since I did not work for a typefoundry, there was no time pressure and the music centre trusted me completely. Under these circumstances I was able to think very freely about the concept of serif and sans. Many of the generally accepted ideas did not seem logical to me; as an independent designer I was luckily not obliged to follow them.</p>

        	<p>I spent some time today designing an invoice for Woo To See You. We wanted a receipt that we can easily add products to, recalculates the subtotal, taxes(PST and GST), and grand total of the bill. Also, Pages enables us to easily share a PDF copy to our customer via the Mac Mail client. Finally, no more fumbling around with a calculator, pen, and carbon copy receipt booklet.</p>

<p>For my latest work on WeddingDJ, I’ve been designing in <a target='_blank' title='Sketch for Mac' href='http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/'>Sketch</a>. One of my favourite features of Sketch is to go back on work and aligned it to the pixel grid. This feature, combined with <a target='_blank' title='Sketch Mirror for iOS' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch-mirror/id677296955?ls=1&mt=8'>Sketch Mirror</a>, gives me assurance that my UI will not look fuzzy.</p>

<p>If you’re using Sketch and you want to get your pixels back on the grid, use “Round to Nearest Pixel Edge” in the Edit menu.</p>
