jekyll-portfolio
================

I’ve made a few aesthetic and stuctural changes to this website. The biggest decision I made was to ditch Wordpress and use Jekyll to compile the site. I realize when I released my last update, building on Wordpress was a documented and intentional decision. Most of the motivation behind that decision was choosing a development path I have experience with.

As for the changes I’ve made to my presentation of content, I’ve included the new [Salome Display](http://www.salomefont.com/) for my h1.logo treatment and all the h2’s throughout the site. Salome was designed by the Spanish multidiscipliary design studio, [Atipo](http://www.atipo.es/). I centred my nav, made the text-content a comfortable max-width: 600px at desktop and tablet for a comfortable line-length, and allowed images to go to a width: 100% to a max-height: 600px. I think these layout choices make for a good experience when viewing images. They can go wide when they need to and scale down for the phone. I also ditched FitVids.js for a CSS solution for responsive video. You can get the markup and CSS for this this trick in [John Surdakowski’s blog post](http://avexdesigns.com/responsive-youtube-embed/) on the __Avex Web Development and Design__ site. There is no more need for a javascript plugin but I’m currently seeking an easy solution for including videos in my markdown. There’s something funny about how the iframe embed is converted from markdown to HTML that is giving Jekyll a stroke.

Welcome to my new, flat, static, responsive, and performant website.
