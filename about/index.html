		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<p><strong>Thanks for visiting.</strong> I’m currently a User-Experience &amp; User-Interface Designer at <a title="Link to Steamclock Software" href="http://www.steamclock.com" target="_blank">Steamclock Software</a>. I live in the world of product strategy, information architecture, and visual design. I care about how things work as much how good things feel.</p>
		<p>At Steamclock, my work involves strategy, information architecture, wire-framing, graphic design, and user interface design. Twice a day, I press fine coffees roasted on the West Coast from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland, and San Francisco. If you’re looking for a crack design and dev team for your next product, or to rev one that already exists, we’re the people to talk to. We are experts in iOS, Android, and the Web.</p>
		<p>Away from work, I spent time at wife’s shop, <a href="http://wootoseeyou.com" title="Woo To See You Boutique" title="_blank">Woo To See You Boutique</a>. When we’re not there you can find us walking our favourite routes through Vancouver, eating at our favourite sushi restaurants, cooking up our favorite meals, inspired by art exhibitions, and connecting with family and friends.</p>
		<p>You can connect with me via <a title="Justin Alm on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/justinalm" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a title="Justin Alm on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/justin.alm" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a title="Justin Alm on Instagram" href="http://instagram.com/justinalm" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="mailto:contact@justinalm.com?Subject=Hello" target="_blank">email</a>.

		<h2>My Professional Experience</h2>

		<h3>Steamclock Software</h3>
		<p><strong>UX &amp; UI Designer</strong> <small><em>Dec. 2012 – Present / Vancouver, Canada Area</em></small><br />
		I design information architecture, wire-frames, interfaces for iOS, Android, and Web apps. I also design digital and analog promo materials; all the things that accompany the launch of an app or website. We recently shipped Map of the Internet for <a title="Peer 1 Hosting blog post about Map of the Internet" href="http://www.peer1.com/blog/peer-1-hosting-launches-map-of-the-internet-app" target="_blank">Peer 1 Hosting</a> to the <a title="Map of the Internet on the App Store" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/map-internet-by-peer-1-hosting/id605924222?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a title="Map of the Internet on Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peer1.internetmap" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and we got coverage on CNN Money. First thing every morning, I press a cup of coffee roasted in the Vancouver area. <em>Life’s good</em>. Checkout <a title="Steamclock Software's Website" href="http://www.steamclock.com" target="_blank">the website I designed and built</a>, aided by the technical geniuses at Steamclock.</p>

		<h3>Free Agency Creative</h3>
		<p><strong>Contract Designer</strong> <small><em>Aug. 2012 – Nov. 2012 / Vancouver, Canada</em></small><br />
		I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for <a title="Link to Nintendo of America's website" href="http://www.nintendo.com/?country=CA&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">Nintendo of America</a>, large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for <a title="Link to Park Royal Shopping Centre" href="http://www.shopparkroyal.com/" target="_blank">Park Royal Shopping Centre</a>, advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver&#8217;s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for <a title="Link to Marketplace Events website" href="http://www.marketplaceevents.com/Main/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Marketplace Events</a> – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.</p>

		<h3>Emily Carr University of Art and Design</h3>
		<p><strong>Interaction Designer</strong> <small><em>Feb. 2012 – Apr. 2012 / Vancouver, Canada</em></small><br />
		I designed the website for the <a title="Link to the Emily Carr University Grad Exhibition Catalogue" href="http://grad2012.ecuad.ca" target="_blank">Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue</a> and directed the deployment of the site to Emily Carr’s servers. Working with a team of students handling the identity of the exhibition, I presented concepts, prototypes, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, throughout the design and production of the catalogue website. The website was designed to make student work easily accessible on any device, on all major browsers. During my research assistantship with ECUAD’s <a title="Link to the Social and Interactive Media Centre Website" href="http://www.simcentre.ca/" target="_blank">Social + Interactive Media</a> and <a title="Link to the Stereoscopic 3D Centre Website" href="http://www.s3dcentre.ca/" target="_blank">Stereoscopic 3D Centres</a>, I conducted interviews, composited /images for feature articles, designed motion graphics for promotional and instructional videos, and published content to their respective websites.</p>

		<h3>Bravado Magazine</h3>
		<p><strong>Interaction Designer</strong> <em><small>Sep. 2011 – Dec. 2011 / Seoul, Korea</small></em><br />
		In the Fall Semester of 2011, I redesigned <a title="Link to Bravado Magazine's website" href="http://www.bravadomagazine.com" target="_blank">BRAVADO Magazine</a> and performed a full WordPress implementation for Evan Goodfellow and his staff. The design of the website involved concept development, paper-prototyping, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP. The final site was converted into a WordPress theme. This website pushes the boundary between image and text on the Internet. Unfortunately, our South Korea audience is enslaved to Internet Explorer.</p>

		<h3>Mozilla Partnered With Emily Carr University</h3>
		<p><strong>Interaction Designer</strong> <em><small>Mar. 2011 – Sep. 2011 / Vancouver, Canada</small></em><br />
		I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who rose to the challenge, investigating technology options for creating an ebook, <a title="Link to Mozilla's Learning, Freedom, and the Web" href="http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/" target="_blank">Learning, Freedom and the Web</a>. We built an ebook that could work on iPads and Android tablets and desktop computers. We designed the ebook to take advantage of the navigation opportunities tablets provide. Working with Vancouver-based development company Steamclock Software(cough — we rock), our team recommended building the book in HTML5, Javascript and CSS.</p>

		<h2>My Education</h2>

		<h3>Emily Carr Institute of Art &amp; Design</h3>
		<p><strong>4 Year Bachelor of Design — Interaction Design</strong> <em><small>2008 – 2012</small></em><br />
		ECUAD’s <a title="Emily Carr University's Interaction Design Degree Program website" href="http://design.ecuad.ca/category/interaction-design" target="_blank">Interaction Design Degree Program</a> has taught me the <a title="Link to my praxis paper about The Complexity of Research for Interactive Design" href="http://issuu.com/designdegreeecuad/docs/justinalm_socs309/8" target="_blank">iterative process of design</a>. From writing proposals, concept development, visual research and exploration, user-testing, refining designs and development, and finishing projects for implementation or hand-off, I’ve been educated to embrace the tension found in the convergent and divergent plot structure of every design project. <em>Activities and Societies</em>: WOO Student Publication, Graduation Exhibition Catalogue 2012, SIM Centre, S3D Centre.</p>

		<h3>University of Saskatchewan</h3>
		<p><strong>4 Year Bachelor of Arts — History</strong> <em>2000 – 2004</em><br />
		The primary focus of my studies was the <a title="Link to the University of Saskatchewan's History Degree Program" href="http://explore.usask.ca/programs/colleges/arts_and_science/history/index.php" target="_blank">History of the Cold War and Conflict Studies</a>. I learned about 19th &amp; 20th Century Europe, Imperialism, and the History of Development. Not the most practical learning but great for writing research papers and grant proposals.</p>

		<h2>Friends + Family</h2>
		<p>Of course, I wouldn’t be writing this without the patient support of my wife, Hans Woo. You’re equally brilliant and beautiful. I also thank my family for putting up with my experimentation with electronics through my youth. I’m sure my noise tested your patience. I’m starting to realize, those years were the foundation for all that I’m doing today.</p>

		<p>Big-ups to my countless friends <em>and</em> acquaintances I want to turn into friends, you’re more of an inspiration than you know. Unfortunately, working on websites like this one put a damper on socializing. I’d like to change that.</p>
