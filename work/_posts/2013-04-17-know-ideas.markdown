[Grey Vaisius](http://greyvy.com/) and I wrote a 130 page book about digital and analogue life. We called it <em>Know Ideas</em>. This project didn’t burnout our friendship. In fact, it proved to me <em>working with others is more fun than working alone</em>. If it wasn’t so expensive to produce, I’d offer a link for you to buy. The book is trade size(<em>9&#8243;x6&#8243;</em>); a comfortable size to casually read. The book features interactive spreads that depict concepts of web interactions through the printed page. Some of these interactive features include: a page fold to hide/show information, French folds that hide the backend from the frontend, layers of acetate for the reader to visually experience layers of meaning, and mirror paper — a poetic link to the screen.
