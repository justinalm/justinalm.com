<p class="work-content">I was approached to design and develop the website for freak-pop, post-hardcore, dance-punk, art punk, experimental rock, progressive band <a href="http://www.fakesharkrealzombie.com/" title="Link to Fake Shark Real Zombie's website" target="_blank">Fake Shark Real Zombie</a>’s release of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/liar/id599166015" title="Link to Fake Shark Real Zombie record Liars on iTunes" target="_blank">Liar</a>. This WordPress website enabled the group to embed their latest video, promote social media pages, drive traffic to their record on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/girls-featuring-steve-bays/id561288437?i=561288555" title="Fake Shark Real Zombie on iTunes" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and merchandise on <a href="http://www.simkinartistmanagement.com/artists/" title="Link to Simkin Artist Management" target="_blank">Simkin Artist Management</a>, and maintain a tour schedule. All of this content was choreographed to respond to any device for the end-user. The people at <a href="http://lightorganrecords.com/" title="Link to Light Organ Records" target="_blank">Light Organ Records</a> were a pleasure to work with. <a href="http://gnargrim.tumblr.com/" title="Mike Shantz website" target="_blank">Mike Shantz</a> created artwork for the project.</p>
