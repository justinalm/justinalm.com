<p class="work-content">Fashion retail can appear superficial, ineffectual, cold, and void of genuine relationships. To combat this sentiment, I worked with Hans Woo defining an identity for her Vancouver based fashion company, Woo To See You. We crafted a visual system of type, pattern, geometric shapes, and colour. Red, white, and blue reference Hans’ South Korean roots. The system transforms potentially banal items into objects that joy. Woo To See You <em>is</em> fun with fashion and is set in a store for people who love clothing. This is not an identity for a trendy boutique. This is an expression of a world-view. Retail <em>is</em> relationships and people should feel <em>good</em> when they say “Woo To See You”.</p>
