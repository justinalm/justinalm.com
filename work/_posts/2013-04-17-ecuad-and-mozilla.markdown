I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who rose to the challenge, investigating technology options for creating an ebook, <a href="http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/" title="Mozilla's Learning, Freedom, and the Web" target="_blank">Learning, Freedom and the Web</a>. We built an ebook that could work on iPads and Android tablets and desktop computers. We designed the ebook to take advantage of the navigation opportunities tablets provide. Working with Vancouver-based development company Steamclock Software(cough â€” we rock), our team recommended building the book in HTML5, Javascript and CSS.
