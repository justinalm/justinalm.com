<p><a href="http://www.woo2cu.com" title="Link to woo2cu website" target="_blank">Woo To See You</a> needed a great online shopping experience to educate people about their brands and offer people an opportunity to purchase products. I set them up with a user-centered responsive website. Throughout the design of the website, the heirarchy of typogrpahy, scale of images, and layout of navigation were tested at various screen sizes. An affordable platform, site speed, legibilty of content, and a quiet-clear shopping experience were the measuring rods for the design.</p>
