I redesigned <a href="http://www.bravadomagazine.com" title="Bravado Magazine" target="_blank">Bravado Magazine</a> for Evan Goodfellow and his staff. The design of the website involved concept development, paper-prototyping, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP. The final site was converted into a WordPress theme for easy publishing to the web. This website pushes the boundary between image and text on the Internet. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t do the best job reaching our South Korea audience enslaved to Internet Explorer.
