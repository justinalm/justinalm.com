I designed and developed the _2012 Emily Carr Graduation Exhibition website_.

Bernie Yao shot footage of students working on their pieces for the exhibition. I edited that footage together and embedded it full-width on the front page of the site.

Within each degree track, student work is organized alphabetically by first name in a 3-up grid.

 Click on a thumbnail for a project and you see 2-3 images of that piece and a video for media arts, film, or animation students. At the bottom of individual project pages, there were thumbnails for 5 more projects within the same degree track.

The most painful part of the project was inputting the 250 projects into a Wordpress. The following year, we remedied that situation at Steamclock Software by developing a Node.js app with a submission form for students and an admin panel for the curators of [The Show 2013](http://theshow2013.ecuad.ca/).

Looking back on this project, I see a problems with the design. Students didn’t submit large enough images to have content expand 100% of the container element, navigation is abstract, and fonts are small for larger screen sizes. The responsive breakpoints don’t force elements to adapt for different screen sizes soon enough and the lack of thumbnails on home page or degree index pages don’t provide the visual preview the student work deserves. As the university administration published the site to the school’s servers, I didn’t have access to the site to make changes and wrangle the navigation and content into a more usable state.

Unfortunately, [Grey Vaisius](http://greyvy.com/) and I were so busy inputting content into the site, we weren’t able to submit our own project, [Know Ideas](http://www.justinalm.com/work/know-ideas.html) to the catalog.
