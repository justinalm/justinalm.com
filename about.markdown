**Recommendation**

*“It’s been a pleasure working with Justin and seeing him grow from a recent grad to a multi-talented app designer. At Steamclock Justin proved himself highly adaptable, tackling a wide variety of tasks across web and apps, digital and print, internally and for clients. He challenged us to level up our design process, while also engaging in the more technical side of the business. I’m excited to see his future success as he takes on more leadership and tackles new challenges.”*

***Aug. 2012 – Nov. 2012***

I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for[Nintendo of America](http://www.nintendo.com/), large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for [Park Royal Shopping Centre](http://www.shopparkroyal.com/), advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver’s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for [Marketplace Events](http://www.nintendo.com/) – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.

### **Interaction Designer – [Emily Carr University of Art & Design](http://www.ecuad.ca/)**

***Feb. 2012 — Apr. 2012***

I designed the website for The [2012 Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue](http://grad2012.ecuad.ca/) and directed the deployment of the site to Emily Carr’s server. Working with a team of students handing the identity of the exhibition, I presented concepts, prototypes, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, throughout the design and production of the catalogue website. The website was designed to make student work easily accessible on any device and major browsers.

**Recommendation**

*“Justin Alm is one of those rare web designers who is just as concerned with the functionality of a website as he is with it’s form, and has the talents and experience to fully deliver both. He is able to produce innovative web design while working within the project’s limitations and deadlines. He is a delight to work with, and I hope to one day be fortunate enough to work with him again.”*

### **Interaction Designer – [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)**

***Mar. — Sept. 2011***

I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who investigated technology options for creating an ebook, [Learning, Freedom and the Web](http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/). We built an ebook for tablets, and desktop computers, and that is distributed for free. We designed it to take advantage of the navigation and multimedia opportunities a tablet could provide. Working with Vancouver-based development company Steamclock Software, our team recommended building the book in HTML5, Javascript and CSS.

## **Education**

### **Emily Carr University of Art & Design – B.Des — Interaction Design**

***2008 — 2012***

The [Interaction Design Degree Program](http://design.ecuad.ca/) has taught me the iterative process of design. From writing proposals, concept development, visual research and exploration, user-testing, refining designs and development, and finishing projects for implementation or delivery, I’ve been educated to embrace the tension found in the convergent and divergent plot structure we find in the narrative of every design project.
