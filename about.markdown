## __Work Experience__

### User Experience Designer ‚Äì Jostle Corporation

<sup>_Jan. 2015 ‚Äî Present_</sup>

I primarily designed features for Jostle‚Äôs SaaS intranet platform, which helps people connect and communicate in the workplace. Features were designed to work across desktop web, iOS, Android, and Android TV clients. Alongside the Design Team, I helped define The [Jostle Style Guide](/work/the-jostle-style-guide/)‚Äîan atomic design system that helps us design consistently and efficiently at scale. I lead product design for Discussions(Chat), Library(File sharing), JostleTV(Your intranet steaming on TV), Calls(1-on-1 and Broadcast video calls), Teams(Jostle‚Äôs patented tech for content distribution), several platform-wide components, and more. I designed and developed pages for Jostle‚Äôs marketing website as well as [The Jostle Blog](/work/the-jostle-blog/). I contributed [weekly illustrations](/work/jostle-illustrations/) for the blog and supported marketing and sales initiatives. I recently completed a 12 month leadership course, which helped me realize I have a lifetime of learning ahead of me.

### Interface Designer ‚Äì Steamclock Software

<sup>_Dec. 2012 ‚Äî Jan. 2015_</sup>

As a designer at Steamclock Software, my work involved strategy, information architecture, wireframing, user interface design, and the design and production of marketing websites and assets. Half of my time at Steamclock was spent designing the products WeddingDJ and PartyMonster. The other half of my time was spent designing various iOS, Android, and web products.

### Contract Designer ‚Äì Free Agency Creative

<sup>_Aug. 2012 ‚Äì Nov. 2012_</sup>

I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for Nintendo of America, large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for Park Royal Shopping Centre, advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver‚Äôs most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for Marketplace Events ‚Äì a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.

### Interaction Designer ‚Äì Emily Carr University of Art + Design

<sup>_Feb. 2012 ‚Äî Apr. 2012_</sup>

I designed and developed the website for The 2012 Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue. I worked alongside a team of students handling the visual identity of the exhibition. The site was prototyped in HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP and then transposed into a WordPress to manage the 250+ student submissions.

### Research Assistant ‚Äì Emily Carr University of Art + Design

<sup>_Jan. 2011 ‚Äî Jan. 2012_</sup>

During my research assistantship with the Social + Interactive Media and Stereoscopic 3D Centres, I conducted interviews, produced graphics for articles, created motion graphics for promotional and instructional videos, and published interviews to the research centre blogs.

### Interaction Designer ‚Äì Emily Carr University of Art + Design in partnership with Mozilla

<sup>_Mar. ‚Äî Sept. 2011_</sup>

I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who investigated technology options for creating the ebook, Learning, Freedom and the Web. We built a free ebook for tablets and desktop computers. We designed it to take advantage of the navigation and multimedia opportunities the web and a tablet could provide. Working with Vancouver-based Steamclock Software, our team built the book in HTML, Javascript and CSS.
