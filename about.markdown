        <p class="u-mar-t01  u-mar-b00">I designed features for Jostle‚Äôs SaaS intranet platform, which helps people connect and communicate in the workplace. Design spanned desktop web, iOS, Android, and Android TV clients. Alongside the Design Team, I helped define The Jostle Style Guide‚Äîan atomic design system. I lead design for Discussions (Chat), Library (File sharing), JostleTV (Your intranet steaming on TV), Calls (1-on-1 and Broadcast video calls), Teams (Jostle‚Äôs patented tech for content distribution), and several components, a complete redesign and build of The Jostle Blog, and more‚Ä¶</p>

        <p class="u-mar-t01  u-mar-b00">At Steamclock Software, my work involved strategy, information architecture, wireframing, user interface design, branding, and marketing for app on iOS and Android. Half of my time at Steamclock was spent designing the products WeddingDJ and PartyMonster. The other half of my time was spent designing various iOS, Android, and web products for clients. I cut my teeth in product design and front-end development. Steamclock gave me the freedom to take risks, learn, and evolve my process. Company and employee benefitted from that trust.</p>
