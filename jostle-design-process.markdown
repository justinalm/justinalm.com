# Jostle’s design process

## Co-creation

At Jostle, there is a strong belief that everyone is responsible for the experiences people have when interacting with the company and product. All designers at Jostle are given the title “UX Designer” because our work applies to the entire journey a person takes with Jostle. You could swap the title “UX Designer” for “Product Designer” and I assume our work wouldn’t change day to day.

Co-creation offers all Jostle employees the opportunity to take ownership of our work and influence the direction of any project. Traditionally, the term co-creation refers to bringing new ideas into your organization by interacting with your customers—people outside your organization. At Jostle, the term co-creation predominantly describes the collaboration between Jostle employees—the internal culture of design thinking and product ownership. Most Jostlers don’t self-identify as a designer but the culture of design thinking and co-creation exists within every team. If co-creation is lacking—the expectation is that it should be fostered.

## Stages of the design process

### Requirements gathering

Understand the problem. Ask a lot of questions.

### Exploration

Think of all the possibilities.

### Concept review

The project is big, and there are several viable options blocking your progress, call a Concept Review to settle down which direction is best. This is also an opportunity to get everyone aligned on where a project is heading.

### Refine and iterate

You have direction. You refine, iterate, expose new questions, and avoid traps. You iterate and debate with your fellow designers, developers, and other key stakeholders. Your design is on solid footing.

### Design review

You feel all major questions have been answered and your design has strong rationale. You call a Design Review. You involve key stakeholders, Developers, QA, Customer Success, Technical Writers, and Product Management. If your design doesn’t pass review. You will iterate again so the issues raised get resolved.

### Build

Your design has passed design review and development begins. Loose ends in your design are addressed. As dev work progresses, yon continue to iterate on your design and you maintain documentation of your work for the QA team to test against. You are building with the developer to bring vision to reality.

### Test

The feature has been developed to a point where it is considered ‘product’. The QA team tries to break the product and find holes in the user experience. You continue to adapt your design to accommodate change.

### Ship

The product is verified by a member of the QA team. You sign-off on the work, approving that it maintains the vision set out in your design. The product is checked into the build for the next release.

### Iterate

The product ships and is used IRL. You begin again.
