*UI/UX, Web, Front-end, iPad*

At Steamclock, I worked on the 2013 [Emily Carr Graduation Exhibition website](http://theshow2013.ecuad.ca/) and[iPad app](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ecuad-grad-catalog/id640841713?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). Students can submit via a web form. Curators can review submissions and approve projects or request resubmission. *The Show* brand was by [Seven25 Design](http://www.seven25.com/).
