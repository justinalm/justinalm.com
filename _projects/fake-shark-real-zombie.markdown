*Mobile First, Responsive, Campaign Site*

I designed and developed a campaign site for [Fake Shark Real Zombie](http://www.fakesharkrealzombie.com/)â€™s release of [Liar](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/liar/id599166015). The site features an updatable video embed, links fans to their [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/girls-featuring-steve-bays/id561288437?i=561288555), and enables the band to maintain a tour schedule.
