***UX/UI, Visal Design, Front-end***

At Steamclock Software, I worked on the design for [Devmonitor.io ](http://www.devmonitor.io/)– a website for developer evangelists to connect with their community. The web app enables a ‘devangelist’ to track questions about their product from sites like Stackoverflow.com.
