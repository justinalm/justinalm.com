*UI/UX, iOS, Android, Visual Design*

At [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com/), I worked on the design for the user interface, app icons, and App Store and Play Store assets for Peer 1â€™s [Map of the Internet](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/map-internet-by-peer-1-hosting/id605924222?mt=8&at=11l4FP&ct=steamclockcom). Concept for the app by Peer 1. Initial design of the UI and 3D visualization by Steamclock Software.
