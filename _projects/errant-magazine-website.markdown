*UX/UI, Front-end, WordPress*

[Grey Vaisius](http://greyvy.com/) and I designed and developed the website for [Errant Magazine](http://www.errantmagazine.ca/). We made wireframes, visual designs, prototypes, and built a WordPress theme for publishing long-form articles, photo essays, and poetry. We included a reference manual.
