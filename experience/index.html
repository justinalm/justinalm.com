		<h2>At Steamclock Software</h2>

		<h2>My Professional Experience</h2>

		<h3>Steamclock Software</h3>
		<p><strong>UX &amp; UI Designer</strong> <small><em>Dec. 2012 – Present / Vancouver, Canada Area</em></small><br />

		<h3>Free Agency Creative</h3>
		<p><strong>Contract Designer</strong> <small><em>Aug. 2012 – Nov. 2012 / Vancouver, Canada</em></small><br />
		I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for <a title="Link to Nintendo of America's website" href="http://www.nintendo.com/?country=CA&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">Nintendo of America</a>, large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for <a title="Link to Park Royal Shopping Centre" href="http://www.shopparkroyal.com/" target="_blank">Park Royal Shopping Centre</a>, advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver&#8217;s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for <a title="Link to Marketplace Events website" href="http://www.marketplaceevents.com/Main/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Marketplace Events</a> – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.</p>

		<h3>Emily Carr University of Art and Design</h3>
		<p><strong>Interaction Designer</strong> <small><em>Feb. 2012 – Apr. 2012 / Vancouver, Canada</em></small><br />
		I designed the website for the <a title="Link to the Emily Carr University Grad Exhibition Catalogue" href="http://grad2012.ecuad.ca" target="_blank">Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue</a> and directed the deployment of the site to Emily Carr’s servers. Working with a team of students handling the identity of the exhibition, I presented concepts, prototypes, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, throughout the design and production of the catalogue website. The website was designed to make student work easily accessible on any device, on all major browsers. During my research assistantship with ECUAD’s <a title="Link to the Social and Interactive Media Centre Website" href="http://www.simcentre.ca/" target="_blank">Social + Interactive Media</a> and <a title="Link to the Stereoscopic 3D Centre Website" href="http://www.s3dcentre.ca/" target="_blank">Stereoscopic 3D Centres</a>, I conducted interviews, composited /images for feature articles, designed motion graphics for promotional and instructional videos, and published content to their respective websites.</p>

		<h2>My Education</h2>

		<h3>Emily Carr Institute of Art &amp; Design</h3>
		<p><strong>4 Year Bachelor of Design — Interaction Design</strong> <em><small>2008 – 2012</small></em><br />
		ECUAD’s <a title="Emily Carr University's Interaction Design Degree Program website" href="http://design.ecuad.ca/category/interaction-design" target="_blank">Interaction Design Degree Program</a> has taught me the <a title="Link to my praxis paper about The Complexity of Research for Interactive Design" href="http://issuu.com/designdegreeecuad/docs/justinalm_socs309/8" target="_blank">iterative process of design</a>. From writing proposals, concept development, visual research and exploration, user-testing, refining designs and development, and finishing projects for implementation or hand-off, I’ve been educated to embrace the tension found in the convergent and divergent plot structure of every design project. <em>Activities and Societies</em>: WOO Student Publication, Graduation Exhibition Catalogue 2012, SIM Centre, S3D Centre.</p>

		<h3>University of Saskatchewan</h3>
		<p><strong>4 Year Bachelor of Arts — History</strong> <em>2000 – 2004</em><br />
		The primary focus of my studies was the <a title="Link to the University of Saskatchewan's History Degree Program" href="http://explore.usask.ca/programs/colleges/arts_and_science/history/index.php" target="_blank">History of the Cold War and Conflict Studies</a>. I learned about 19th &amp; 20th Century Europe, Imperialism, and the History of Development. Not the most practical learning but great for writing research papers and grant proposals.</p>

		<h2>Friends + Family</h2>
		<p>To my loving wife Hans, you’re equally brilliant and beautiful. I also thank my family for putting up with my experimentation with electronics through my youth. I’m sure my noise tested your patience. I’m starting to realize, those years were the foundation for all that I’m doing today.</p>

		<p>Big-ups to my countless friends <em>and</em> acquaintances I want to turn into friends, you’re more of an inspiration than you know. Unfortunately, working on websites like this one put a damper on socializing. I’d like to change that.</p>
