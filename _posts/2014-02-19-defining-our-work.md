I enjoyed the [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/) episode [Michael Parkinson on the adverts](http://unfinished.bz/57). Andrew Clarke with Elliot Kember discuss the definitions of “code” and “programming” in relation to [The Year of Code](http://yearofcode.org/); a campaign championed by Lottie Dexter.

> We are programming the computer using a programming language, which is different from web development, with HTML and CSS. Those two things are different. We are not conflating the two things together and saying _code_. That’s what irks me and I think irks a lot of other people. It makes it sound as if coding is one homogeneous thing. I know it’s the same thing(homogeneous) when you’re sitting there and literally writing in a text editor … Writing HTML requires a different set of skills to writing … Javascipt.

> It doesn’t matter! These are the things you discover as you’re doing it … You get there through lots of time – _doing it_ … I’m the biggest language pedant in the world. I’m the semicolon guy. I know when to use them but … when it comes to the meaning and difference of two words, which are both very new … it’s immaterial. The words are still gaining their meaning. I think it detracts from the whole point of teaching more people how to do this important fourth skill …

> What if … what they’re actually teaching these kids is not the _code_ itself. Not the HTML, Javascript, and Python but the actual mentality that you sit down and _code_ at the computer – the methodology of the physical act of doing it. If that’s the case, then _programming_ isn’t the right word to use … I don’t even think software development is the right word to use. The actual process of sitting down and using the computer to build something; we don’t have a word for that, that accurately fits all web design, design, and programming … we don’t have a word that’s right … Call it whatever you want. The message gets across that these kids are going to use the computer to create things.

As a user experience and user interface designer at Steamclock, I wear a lot of hats. I cross the lines of creative direction, user experience, user interface, visual design, and front-end development. My line of work is interdisciplinary. When thinking about what _I do_, I understand it as a series of tests to find the best solution for a visual problem. These tests involve shaping content. I test visual possibilities to find a pleasing way to interact with content on screens.

The work requires investigation into technical constraints, and prototyping to see how drawings transcribe onto mobile devices as interactive layouts. I communicate with people, to understand how goals, assumptions, expectations, time and budget limitations, feature requests, and bad ideas put pressure on the entire project. All of these things can change the detail of an icon, the shape of a button, or the placement of a picture in the UI.

Andrew and Elliott’s attempt to define _code_ and _programming_ makes me think of our stuggle to define all the work we do in technology. The roles people play are constantly changing. Elliott suggests a new word for describing the process of sitting down and using the computer to build things. This is the act that unifies designer, engineer, project manager, technical officer, accountant, content strategist, and everyone else. We all build things with keyboards, mice, screens, and software.

Designing interactive products is not like being a butcher, baker, and candle stick maker. What should we call people who use a computer to build things?
