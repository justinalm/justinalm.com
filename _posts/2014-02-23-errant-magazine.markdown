<p>Grey Vaisius and I designed the responsive website for <a href="http://www.errantmagazine.ca" title="Steamclock Software" target="_blank">Errant Magazine</a>. Mobile first was the most appropriate design strategy for a literary travel publication. We planned the information architecture, sketched wireframes, visual designs, static prototypes for testing layouts in HTML and CSS, and built a Wordpress theme for the staff at Errant to publish long-form articles, photo essays, and poetry. Included in the project was a user manual for their website. As a parting gift, we diagrammed everything they needed to know to confidently publish content through the admin interface.</p>
