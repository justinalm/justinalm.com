During my vacation, I built a fitting room at the [Woo To See You Boutique](http://www.wootoseeyou.com), went for a hike up the [Lynn Valley Canyon](http://lynncanyon.ca/), drove a [ZipCar](http://www.zipcar.com/) for the first time(Mini), and made almost daily trips to [JJ Bean Yaletown](http://www.jjbeancoffee.com/our-locations/yaletown/) for cappucinos, coding, and design. I’m the type of person that likes to use holidays for personal work.

On Thursday, I sat down to work on this website and [CleanMyMac](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac) popped up on my screen. I had free time to run a scan and delete the cruft from [Mavericks](http://www.apple.com/ca/osx/). This was a bad idea. Application and document icons disappeared from Finder. App Store, Contacts, Calendar, and Messages ceased to open. They would bounce once or twice, the highlight would appear in the Dock, but the application frame wouldn’t open. Interestingly, the Chrome icon was the only icon to disappeared from the Dock. After digging around on Google, I learned my old version of CleanMyMac was the culprit and [CleanMyMac 2](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac) won’t criple your Mavericks.

__Don’t run an old version of CleanMyMac on Mavericks!__ Get [CleanMyMac 2](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac).
