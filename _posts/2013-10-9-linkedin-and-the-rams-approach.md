I’m taking the [Rams](http://www.gestalten.tv/motion/dieter-rams) approach on [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42288841&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile) by deleting items from my skills and expertise. I feel like the words I’ve used to describe my work were not as relevant and I’d like them to be. I think “Experience Design” and “User Experience” are essentially the same thing. I’m considering another round of deletions to my LinkedIn skills because I don’t know how I feel about terms like “User-centred Design”. Aren’t all designs ‘user-centred’? The products I work on have been designed for people to use.

Maybe I should host a small web-based funneral for each debunked adjective I’ve used to describe my career. I’m still hanging on to my unendorsed “Branding & Identity”. I’ve developed several identities and pulled the iron out of the fire to brand the shit out of correspondence tools and marketing material. 

People can endorse you with skills and expertise you did not claim on you profile. You can read pages of complaints on [this LinkedIn community thread](http://community.linkedin.com/questions/16624/why-am-i-being-endorsed-for-skills-and-expertise-i.html).
