I just finished reading [Martin Majoor’s philosophy of typeface design](http://martinmajoor.com/6_my_philosophy.html). Woven into the philosophical basis for his work is an in-depth explanation of serif and sans-serif typeface design. This is a great read for anyone interested in why sans-serif type looks the way it does. Majoor reminded me about the benefits of working in a *free* environment:

> …since I did not work for a typefoundry, there was no time pressure and the music centre trusted me completely. Under these circumstances I was able to think very freely about the concept of serif and sans. Many of the generally accepted ideas did not seem logical to me; as an independent designer I was luckily not obliged to follow them.
