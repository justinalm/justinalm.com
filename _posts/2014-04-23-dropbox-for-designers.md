_Dropbox for Designers_.

Yesterday we switched to [Dropbox for Business](https://www.dropbox.com/business). I’ve been syncing the Steamclock Archive and reorganizing my personal Dropbox. As the estimated sync time is a couple days, I’ve been trying to work with Dropbox running. This should be reasonable but instead OSX is crippled. Opening, closing, and toggling between Finder tabs has several seconds of delay. Basic interactions like typing have delayed feedback. I wrote almost the entirety of this post blind. After digging around on Google, I am aware that [I’m not the only person](http://www.quora.com/Dropbox/Why-does-Dropbox-slow-down-my-Mac) dealing with this problem. It looks like quitting Dropbox and syncing while I sleep is the solution for now.
