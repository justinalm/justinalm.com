This is an interesting post by <a href="http://www.ustwo.co.uk/" title="ustwo" target="_blank">ustwo</a> about the “Sea of Japan” label on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/?hl=tr" title="Google Static Maps API" target="_blank">Google Static Maps API</a>. Apparently, this label frustrated South Korea users of their <a href="http://www.ustwo.co.uk/blog/introducing-rando/" title="Rando Diplomacy App" target="_blank">Rando Diplomacy App</a>. I love how politics and technology collide. South Koreans have all the right to find that label annoying. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_disputes" title="Disputes between South Korea and Japan" target="_blank">the history</a> of disputes between these two nations of the Orient.
