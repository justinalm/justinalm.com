    <h2 id="why-I-joined-jostle" class="u-pad-t05  u-mar-t00">1. Why I joined Jostle</h2>
    <p>At Steamclock, I was steeped in the world of consumer mobile apps. In the mobile app dev community, there was distain toward the enterprise, a thinking that enterprise products are <em>always</em> compromised, “<em>not</em> sexy”, <em>painful</em> to work on, and <em>always</em> sloppy in execution. I had a nagging question:</p>
    <blockquote class="as-h5  c-grey03  u-noMargin"><p><em>“Can design help make an enterprise product beautiful?”</em></p></blockquote>
    <p>I wanted to find out for myself. December of 2014, David Humphrey approached me. He was then a UX Designer at Jostle. He was getting ready to move on from Jostle and told me I should take his job. This was the opportunity I was looking for—to see if design could make and enterprise product beautiful.</p>

    <p>I was a key contributor in the development of marketing and product user experiences. I took full design responsibility for specific improvements and advances, collaborating across all teams to define best user experiences, validating my design decisions by interacting with customers and other Jostlers. I investigated how people interacted with the product and how our customers could get more out of Jostle to in their workplaces.</p>
    <p>I spec’d design solutions so the team had the necessary details to build, test, and documented new features for our end users. I also worked with developers to improve implementation throughout the dev cycle; I shared my observations and suggested improvements. I contributed to the co-creative process and helped my colleagues achieve more through design thinking; and stayed current with industry best practices competitors.</p>

    <h3 class="u-noMargin  u-mar-t02">How we qualified requests</h3>
    <p>Feature requests that delivered value to all customers were deemed worthy of product development. That said, Jostle was used by customers in many different industries: Health Care, Finance, Law, Design, Construction, Retail, Aviation, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Public Administration, Transportation, Arts and Entertainment, Education, etc.. Sometimes requests from the biggest (or loudest) customers were moved up the ladder of priority.</p>
    <p>Features deemed worthy of work were captured in Jira, Trello, a Google Spreadsheet, or ‘Vision’ document. Often, these sources were not kept in sync and there was done to organize or attain an effective overview of the “product development landscape”.</p>

    <p><strong>Design alone cannot make an enterprise product beautiful</strong>—it’s a combination of brand, product management, engineering, and design. <strong>Product management is a struggle</strong> at Jostle and led to a lot of miscommunication on what’s being worked on and what has priority. At the team grew, <strong>not all projects followed the same process</strong>, which was inevitable. As this happened, it became apparent <strong>we needed a single source or truth</strong> for product development.</p>
    <p>Jostle seeks to be all things to all customers. Product strategy was rarely informed by product values, KPIs, or goals for measuring our success. In addition, we didn’t have analytics to inform our product decisions.</p>
    <p>Although we were missing product vision and other useful product management approaches, we were all aligned on the goal to connect people in the workplace and offer organizations the tools to make their culture vibrant.</p>
    <p><strong>We didn’t have clear goals, KPIs, or costs for the product development</strong>, outside of increasing ARR and this meant almost every request qualified as “to do”. We <strong>lacked measurement of success</strong>. I believe this lack of direction alloweds the <strong>product to grow horizontally</strong>, into many “products”, making it difficult to know what’s moving the needle without leaning on intuition.</p>
