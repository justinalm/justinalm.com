According to the hi-speed history of the Internet, I’m way late in my critique on the design of iOS 7. I’m glad I’ve kept my opinions to myself – for the most part – and let the UI speak to me after a few months of user experience. I still don’t feel compelled to write about the overhaul because there’s enough chatter out there on the Internet. I have stumbled upon Jarard Johnson’s interesting article on the topic of redesigns. He gave voice to the disapproving ‘vets’ _and_ the ‘young guns’ flooding [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/search?q=ios7+redesign) with visions of what they thought Apple’s design should have been. This is what makes his article an interesting read and transcends the critique of UI to elevate our thinking to what really matters.

> For many designers there is a turning point where design changes from making things pretty to making things work. It is at this time in a designer’s career that unsolicited redesigns start to make a lot less sense.
