<p>Grey Vaisius and I designed the identity for <a href="http://www.errantmagazine.ca" title="Steamclock Software" target="_blank">Errant Magazine</a>. We went on a journey of identity and branding with Errant that started with and exploration of 3 visual concepts. Each concept included keywords, moodbards, word marks, monograms, and web page layouts. From those 3 directions, we asked Errant to chose the direction that best represents their publication. The chosen one was refined and became the form driver for rollout of the identity.</p>
