            <p><strong>Valeting your car can be frustrating</strong>—even though it’s a luxury. <strong>You need cash</strong> to pay and tip your valet but society is increasingly cashless. <strong>Waiting is painful</strong>. Before queuing to pickup your car, you spend 5-10 minutes wrangling your kids and belongings. Then you wait outside for another 5-20 minutes in 30 degree heat. Hot climates help valet companies succeed.</p>

            <p><strong>Managing a valet business is difficult</strong>. Often, valet companies operate on <strong>antiquated systems</strong>. I mean, cash only??? Too often payments and tips slip into the valet’s pocket instead of the company bank account. The <strong>company doesn’t have visibility</strong> into their locations to understand who’s working, the number of cars parked at a time, revenue collected, and tips shared.</p>

            <p><strong>We streamlined the management of valet parking</strong> and improved the experience for customers in two key ways: we allowed for <strong>payment on the user’s smartphone</strong> rather than in cash and we created a <strong>virtual line up system</strong>, where users can notify the valet a few minutes in advance of when their car is needed. For the system to work, we built these five elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>An identity and brand</strong> to bring consistency across the system.</li>
                <li><strong>A consumer smartphone app</strong> for paying the valet and requesting your car.</li>
                <li><strong>A valet management app</strong> for valets to use.</li>
                <li><strong>A scannable printed ticket</strong> for the customer and valet to scan.</li>
                <li><strong>A hosted online service</strong> to tie the previously mentioned services together and provide the valet companies visibility into transactions.</li>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Identity and brand</h3>
    <p>To kick off the project, I developed Valet65’s identity and brand. I presented 3 directions for Valet65 to choose from. They selected the first because it most closely aligned with the tastes of people who typically valet their car. This clear direction for Valet65’s identity paid off as we built out the system.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Architecture</h3>
    <p>Before starting in on any wireframing or visual design, I mapped actions and decisions a person would make to complete goals. This gave me an inventory of design needs.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>With this high-level architecture mapped out, I was then able to start wireframing screens. The following is a deep dive into the user experience for the consumer and company apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <h3>Consumer app</h3>
    <p><strong>Scan ticket</strong><br>The QR code scanner is the first thing you see when opening the app. You hover your phone over a QR code. When the scan is successfully, you are taken to the home view. If the QR code is invalid, an error is appears.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Request your car</strong><br>To request your car, tap the “Request Your Car” button on the home view. Allow push notifications from Valet65 and select when you want your car. You’re then taken back to the home view where the “Request Your Car” button now displays an “Arrives in ...” countdown.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>On the home view, tap the “Pay Your Valet” button. Then enter your credit card information and tap submit. You’ll see a summary with the total. After you “Confirm payment”, you’re taken back to the home view. The “Pay Your Valet” button updates to “Paid”. We used Stripe for security and to speed up future transactions with stored credit card info.</p>

    <p><strong>Notifications from the valet</strong><br>
    You recieve notifications from the valet when your car is on the way or ready. This way you don’t have to open Valet65 again after you’ve paid and requested your car.</p>

    <p><strong>Scan another ticket</strong><br>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Scannable printed ticket</h3>
    <p><strong>Physical characteristics</strong><br>I designed the tickets to be slightly oversized(2.75" x 7") so customers could easily find their stub burried deep in their purse. The ticket has 2 horizontal perforations for easy separation. The valet keeps the top half and customer keeps bottom half.</p>

    <p><strong>Structure of URL for QR codes</strong><br>Valet tickets were printed using variable data printing. Big words, eh? Essentially, this means we could dynamically generate new QR codes for the tickets, which pointed to the “digital ticket” on the Valet65 servers.</p>
    <p>The system for generating the QR codes had to scale along with the web service. Tickets were printed in batches for valet companies so the company ID number doesn’t change as often as the individual ticket number. Before the ticket number we inserted an random set of 8 numbers and characters. Without this a hacker could request someone’s car by generating a QR Code on the internet.</p>

    <h2><a id=""></a>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed working on this project because it <strong>served consumer and business needs</strong>. Valet65 came to us with an idea and we were able to build them what they needed to launch. We delivered an identity, app, printed ticket, admin web app, marketing websites, and App Store listing in <strong>less than 3 months</strong>!</p>
    <p>Their concept wasn’t rocket science but as we followed our process, we <strong>simplified complexity</strong> lingering below the surface. <strong>As with every project, there are things I would change</strong>. Language on buttons and in push notifications could be more consistent and contextual. Many other UI elements within the system could have been improved.</p>
    <p>The <strong>release of iOS 7</strong> mid-project threw a wrench into the gears. We suddenly had back buttons that didn’t look like buttons. Product designers at that time were all to familiar with worry over buttons that didn’t look like buttons.</p>
    <p>When I designed Valet65, good <strong>prototyping tools didn’t exist</strong> so we could’ve worked harder on UI animations instead of remaining in static spec-land. All of these stresses were compounded by time and budget constraints—meaning the <strong>number of iterations</strong> for various stages of the project were limited.</p>
    <p>All of that said, <strong>I am super proud of how we actualized Valet65’s idea</strong> into fully functional startup in less than 3 months—otherwise I wouldn’t have this in my portfolio! 😁</p>
