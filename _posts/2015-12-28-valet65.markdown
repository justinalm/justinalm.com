            <p><strong>Valeting your car can be frustrating</strong>—even though it’s a luxury. <strong>You need cash</strong> to pay and tip your valet but society is increasingly cashless. <strong>Waiting is painful</strong>. Before queuing to pickup your car, you spend 5-10 minutes wrangling your kids and belongings. Then you wait outside for another 5-20 minutes in 30 degree heat. Hot climates help valet companies succeed.</p>

            <p><strong>Managing a valet business is difficult</strong>. Often, valet companies operate on <strong>antiquated systems</strong>. I mean, cash only??? Too often payments and tips slip into the valet’s pocket instead of the company bank account. The <strong>company doesn’t have visibility</strong> into their locations to understand who’s working, the number of cars parked at a time, revenue collected, and tips shared.</p>

            <p><strong>We streamlined the management of valet parking</strong> and improved the experience for customers in two key ways: we allowed for <strong>payment on the user’s smartphone</strong> rather than in cash and we created a <strong>virtual line up system</strong>, where users can notify the valet a few minutes in advance of when their car is needed. For the system to work, we built these five elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>An identity and brand</strong> to bring consistency across the system.</li>
                <li><strong>A consumer smartphone app</strong> for paying the valet and requesting your car.</li>
                <li><strong>A valet management app</strong> for valets to use.</li>
                <li><strong>A scannable printed ticket</strong> for the customer and valet to scan.</li>
                <li><strong>A hosted online service</strong> to tie the previously mentioned services together and provide the valet companies visibility into transactions.</li>
            </ol>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Identity and brand</h3>
    <p>To kick off the project, I took some time develop Valet65’s identity and brand. I knew that having a clear visual direction for Valet65’s identity would going to pay off as we built out the system. As you can see below, I developed 3 directions for Valet65 to choose from. Valet65 chose the first option because they felt it closely aligned with the tastes of people who valet their car.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Architecture</h3>
    <p>Before starting in on any wireframing or visual design, I mapped actions and decisions a person would make to complete goals. This gave me an inventory of design needs.</p>
</div>

    <img style="max-width: 1024px;" src="/assets/steamclock/valet65/information-architecture.jpg" alt="Information architecture detailing user journeys and decisions we needed to design for." />
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>With this high-level architecture mapped out, I was then able to start wireframing screens. The following is a deep dive into the user experience for the consumer and company apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <h3>Consumer app</h3>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>We built a QR code scanner into the app. The scanner is the first thing the customer sees when opening the app. To scan a ticket, you hover your phone over a QR code. When the app scans successfully, you are taken to the home view. If the QR code is invalid, we display an error at the top of the screen saying, “The QR code you scanned is invalid.”</p>
</div>

    <img style="max-width: 934px;" src="/assets/steamclock/valet65/scan-ticket.jpg" alt="Wireframe of scanning a ticket" />
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Requesting your car</strong><br>To request your car, tap the “Request Your Car” button on the home view. Allow push notifications from Valet65 and select when you want your car. You’re then taken back to the home view where the “Request Your Car” button now displays an “Arrives in ...” countdown.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>The customer can now pay the valet before leaving the table. Tap the “Pay Your Valet” button on the home view, enter your credit card information, and tap submit. We integrated Stripe for payments so credit card info we securely stored to speed up future transactions on Valet65. After adding a tip, review the total and “Confirm Payment”. When payment is complete, you’re taken back to the home view and the “Pay Your Valet” button displays a “Paid” label.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>When your car is ready</strong><br>
    The label on the “Arrives in ...” button updates to indicate when your car is ready for pickup.</p>
    <p class="u-textAlign-center"><img style="max-width: 574px;" src="/assets/steamclock/valet65/car-ready.jpg" alt="Wireframe of car ready" /></p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Notifications from the valet</strong><br>
    The customer recieves notifications from the valet when their car is on the way or ready. This way you don’t have to open Valet65 again after you’ve paid and requested your car.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Scanning another ticket</strong><br>
    The app resets to the QR code scanner on the consumer app after the valet closes out your transaction. Customers can also scan another ticket by tapping the “Scan a new ticket” button on the home view.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Company facing app</h3>
    <p>For design of the company facing app, we stayed with stock iOS 7 components.</p>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>After logging into Valet65, you see the “Cars In Queue”. To add a car to the queue, tap the “+” button and scan the QR code on the ticket. The “Add Details” view appears. Add a note with details about the car.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <p><strong>Liability check and adding the car to the queue</strong><br>After doing some beta testing with Skyline Valet—a Vancouver valet company—we added a “Liability Check” feature. This is a 1-tap way for the valet to be protected from any liabilities that may arise while the car is parked.</p>
    <p>Tap “Done” and the car is added to the bottom of the “Cars In Queue”.</p>

    <p><strong>Notifications from customers</strong><br>When a customer requests their car, you receive a push notification with the who, what, where, and ticket number of the car being requested. Tap “View Details” on the notification to see the car details in Valet65s and send push a response back to the customer.</p>

    <p><strong>Completing a request</strong><br>You can clear completed cars from the list by tapping on the car in the “Cars In Queue”. At the bottom of the car details, tap on the “Close Out” button. Confirm the “Close Out” on the action sheet.</p>

    <p><strong>Logout</strong><br>We added “Log out” so employees could share a mobile phone swith Valet65 installed on it. This way the employee could log out when on a break or end of shift. This shift data is also then available to the company.</p>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Scannable printed ticket</h3>
    <p><strong>URL structure for QR codes</strong><br>
    I designed the tickets to be printed in batches for valet companies. The Company ID Number doesn’t change for each licensed customer but the Individual Ticket Number does. For our beta test, we set the Valet Company ID to 1—the were the first customer!</p>
    <p>Infront of the actual ticket number, we added an 8 digit randomly generated set of numbers and characters inserted into the URL. We needed this to prevent hackers on the system. They could request someone else’s car by generating a QR Code on the internet.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <p><strong>Production details</strong><br>
        Valet tickets were printed with variable data printing. That way we could dynamically generate new QR codes, which pointed to the “digital ticket” on the Valet65 servers. We designed the tickets to be slightly oversized—2.75" (W) x 7" (H)—so customers could easily find their stub burried deep in their purse. The ticket had 2 horizontal perforations for easy separation. The valet keeps the top half and customer keeps bottom half, which includes liability info.</p>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Web app for company management</h3>
    <p>We built a simple web application for an admin from the valet company to log into. This enabled company admins to check sales, set rates, enable/disable features within the iOS app, and edit their company information.</p>
