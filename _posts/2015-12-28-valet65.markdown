    <h2><a id=""></a>Our promise</h2>
    <p>Streamline the management of valet parking. Improve the experience for customers in two key ways: allow for payment on the user’s smartphone rather than in cash and a virtual line up system, where users can notify the valet a few minutes in advance of when their car is needed. For the system to work, we needed these five elements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>An identity and brand</strong> to visually tie toegther all elemets in the system.</li>
        <li><strong>A consumer smartphone app</strong> for the person who is parking their car to do the payment and request a car pickup.</li>
        <li><strong>A valet management app</strong> for the valets to use.</li>
        <li><strong>A scannable printed ticket</strong> for the customer and valet to scan.</li>
        <li><strong>A hosted online service</strong> to tie the previously mentioned services together.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id=""></a>Identity and brand</h2>
    <p>To kick off the project, I took some time develop Valet65’s identity and brand. I knew with the number of deliverables in this project, having a clear visual direction for their identity was going to pay off in spades. I developed 3 options for them to pick from, as presented below. In the end, Valet65 chose the first option because they felt it would resonate with people who typically valet their car.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id=""></a>App architecture</h2>
    <p>Before making anything visual, I started by quickly exploring the architecture of the application. I wanted to discover all of the actions and decisions a person will have to make so that we had an inventory of design needs.</p>

    <h2>Wireframing the experience</h2>
    <h3 class="u-mar-t02"><a id=""></a>The customer facing app</h3>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>Upon opening the app, you’re prompted to scan your ticket. Hover your phone over the QR code on your ticket and once it is scanned, you’ll be taken to the Home View. Invalid QR codes will return an error at the top of the screen saying, “The QR code you canned is invalid.”</p>

You’ll be taken back to the Home View where you’ll see the “Request Your Car” button has been replaced with the “Arrives in ...” countdown clock. In this scenario, you needed 20 minutes, the valet got the message and is working on your request.</p>

    <h2><a id=""></a>Scannable printed ticket</h2>
    <p><strong>URL structure for QR codes</strong><br>
    Tickets will be printed in batches for the valet companies. The Company ID Number won’t change for each licnensed customer but the Individual Ticket Number will. For our Beta- test, the Valet Company ID will be 1.</p>
    <p>Infront of the actual ticket number, we need a 8 Digit randomly generated set of numbers and characters inserted into the URL. We need this so people can’t ‘hack’ the system and request someone else’s car by generating a QR Code on the Internet.</p>

    <p><strong>Production details</strong><br>
        Valet Tickets were printed with variable data printing. That way we could dynamically generate new QR codes, which pointed to the “digital ticket” on Valet65’s servers. We designed the tickets to be slightly oversized (2.75" (W) x 7" (H)) so customers could easily find their stub when it was burried deep in their purse. The tickets had 2 horizontal perfs; the valet keeps the top half and customer keeps bottom half, which includes the liability info.</p>
