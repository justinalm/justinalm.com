            <p><strong>Veleting your car can be frustrating</strong>—even though it’s a luxury. <strong>You need cash</strong> to pay and tip your valet but society is increasingly cashless. <strong>Waiting is painful</strong>. Before queuing to pickup your car, you spend 5-10 minutes wrangling your kids and belongings. Then you wait outside for another 5-20 minutes in 30 degree heat. Hot climates are where valet companies succeed.</p>

            <p><strong>Managing a valet business is difficult</strong>. Often, valet companies operate on <strong>antiquated systems</strong>. What could be more antiquated than cash? Too often payments and tips slip into the valet’s pocket instead of the company bank account. The <strong>company doesn’t have visibility</strong> into their locations to understand who’s working, the number of cars parked at a time, revenue collected, and tips shared.</p>

            <p><strong>We streamlined the management of valet parking</strong> and improved the experience for customers in two key ways: we allowed for <strong>payment on the user’s smartphone</strong> rather than in cash and we created a <strong>virtual line up system</strong>, where users can notify the valet a few minutes in advance of when their car is needed. For the system to work, we built these five elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>An identity and brand</strong> to visually tie toegther all elemets in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>A consumer smartphone app</strong> for the person who is parking their car to do the payment and request a car pickup.</li>
                <li><strong>A valet management app</strong> for the valets to use.</li>
                <li><strong>A scannable printed ticket</strong> for the customer and valet to scan.</li>
                <li><strong>A hosted online service</strong> to tie the previously mentioned services together.</li>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Identity and brand</h3>
    <p>To kick off the project, I took some time develop Valet65’s identity and brand. I knew with the number of deliverables in this project, having a clear visual direction for their identity was going to pay off as we built each piece. As you can see below, I developed 3 directions for Valet65 to choose from. Valet65 chose the first option because they felt it most closely aligned with the type of clientel who will valet their car.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Architecture</h3>
    <p>Before starting in on any wireframing or visual design, I mapped actions and decisions a person would make to complete goals. This gave me an inventory of design needs.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>With this higher level architecture of the app mapped out, I was then able to start in on wireframing screens. The following is a deep dive into the user experience in both apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <h3>Customer facing app</h3>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>Upon opening the app, you’re prompted to scan your ticket. Hover your phone over the QR code on your ticket. When it scans, you are taken to the home view. Invalid QR codes return an error at the top of the screen saying, “The QR code you canned is invalid.”</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Requesting your car</strong><br>You can request your car in seconds by tapping the “Request Your Car” button on the home view. Then approve push notifications from Valet65, and select when you want your car. You’re then taken back to the home view where the “Request Your Car” button has been replaced with the “Arrives in ...” countdown clock. In the following scenario, you needed 20 minutes. The valet was notified and is working on your request.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>Tap the “Pay Your Valet” button on the home view. Then enter your credit card information in the field and tap submit. You’re now setup for future credit card transactions on Valet65. Tap the “Add Tip” field to add a tip. Then tap the “Add Tip” button to add the tip to your bottom line. Review your expense and tap the “Confirm Payment” button. Payment is complete and you’re taken back to the home view. <strong>Note</strong>: The “Pay Your Valet” button is replaced with the “Paid” button.</p>

    <p><strong>Indicating your car is ready</strong><br>
    Stay on the Home View and know when your car is ready. There’s no need to checkout another view, the state of the “Arrives in ...” button changes to indicate your car is ready for pickup.</p>

    <p><strong>Push notifications for arrival status</strong><br>
    You’re notified about the status of your request throughout iOS. If you need to get other things done on your phone while waiting, Valet65 will send Push Notifications throughout the process.</p>

    <p><strong>Scanning another ticket</strong><br>
    Didn’t use the app at your last stop? It’s OK. When you get to the next stop and valet your car, restart the sequence by tapping the “Scan a new ticket” tab on the Home View.</p>

    Tickets will be printed in batches for the valet companies. The Company ID Number won’t change for each licnensed customer but the Individual Ticket Number will. For our Beta- test, the Valet Company ID will be 1.</p>
    <p>Infront of the actual ticket number, we need a 8 Digit randomly generated set of numbers and characters inserted into the URL. We need this so people can’t ‘hack’ the system and request someone else’s car by generating a QR Code on the Internet.</p>

        Valet Tickets were printed with variable data printing. That way we could dynamically generate new QR codes, which pointed to the “digital ticket” on Valet65’s servers. We designed the tickets to be slightly oversized (2.75" (W) x 7" (H)) so customers could easily find their stub when it was burried deep in their purse. The tickets had 2 horizontal perfs; the valet keeps the top half and customer keeps bottom half, which includes the liability info.</p>
