    <h2><strong>Why I joined Jostle</strong></h2>
    <p>At Steamclock, I was steeped in the world of consumer mobile apps. In the mobile app dev community, there was distain toward the enterprise, a thinking that enterprise products are always compromised, “not sexy”, painful to work on, and always sloppy in execution. I had a nagging question:</p>
    <blockquote class="as-h5  c-grey03  u-noMargin"><p><em>“Can design help make an enterprise product beautiful?”</em></p></blockquote>
    <p>I wanted to find out for myself. December of 2014, David Humphrey approached me. He was then a Product Designer at Jostle. He was getting ready to move on from Jostle and told me I should take his job. This was the opportunity I was looking for—to see if design could make and enterprise product beautiful.</p>
    <h2><strong>What is Jostle?</strong></h2>
