Morgan Knutson wrote one of my favorite article’s [It’s A Matter of Taste](http://articles.morganallanknutson.com/its-a-matter-of-taste) on the [Svbtle Network](https://svbtle.com). In the article, he explains his thoughts about the flat versus depth debate in design. I really appreciated Morgan’s article and now I’m wondering what happened with the roll-out of the new UI for DropBox on iOS 7. Things have definitely changed and I would say this is not the soft, heart-warming, ‘juuust right’ approach Morgan stood up for.

> I don’t believe that either “style” or “philosophical stance” is more correct or better than the other. I often believe that the answer is somewhere in between, and always believe that the right tool should be used for the right job. Sometimes UI calls for flat elements and sometimes it calls for dimensional ones.

Is even a hint of drop shadow too much for iOS 7 users? Morgan, are you still designing at DropBox?
