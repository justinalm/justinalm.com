How would you like to start 2014 with your business partner suing you for over $100M plus half of the company and punitive damages? This lawsuit is evidence that type design is serious business. Part of me wants to believe this story is a sham but it’s public. Read [the claim](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=ydQwzs4EZjDkplRrBmkkwA==&system=prod) for yourself.

John Gruber said it best:

> No matter how this turns out, it’s a terribly sad turn of events. I feel obligated, however, to point out that there is no little irony in the fact that Frere-Jones’s complaint is set in Arial.

Sometimes words are more important than the typeface they are set in.
