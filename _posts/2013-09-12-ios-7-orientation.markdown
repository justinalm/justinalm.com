I rarely feel lost because I have a fairly good sense of direction. I’m one of those people who likes to know which direction is North. Once I know, I don’t forget. This said, Compass of [iOS 7](http://www.apple.com/ios) is one of the most visually interesting orientation tools I’ve ever used. The buttonless UI feels like a liquid pool inside my black iPhone 4s. A nice addition to the new Compass is a level. I highly enjoyed using the level on our shop tables at [Woo To See You](http://wootoseeyou.com). I’ve caught myself levelling things around me just to see if what *looks straight* is actually straight. Surprisingly, most surfaces are out by 1 degree. If you put your iPhone on its side, the app is great for levelling pictures. Getting the green light is satisfying.
