I just finished [Episode 85](http://5by5.tv/eastwing/85) of __The East Wing__. I was most impressed by Wren Lanier’s thoughts about finding success:

> I think people succeed because of their humility, willingness to help others, and ability to give back to the community. It’s servant leadership. If you’re wondering, “How do I advance my career?”, I think the way you advance your career is by helping people. Helping people is a better path to success than just trying to put yourself at the front of the crowd over, and over, and over again.
