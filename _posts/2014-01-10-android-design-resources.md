Designing for Android feels more wild west than designing for iOS. I have a general sense mystery working on this project. The [Android Design Guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html) are good, but there are several controls that are not explicity explained and don’t have visual examples. [Section headers in lists](http://developer.android.com/design/building-blocks/lists.html) and [section headers in form controls](http://developer.android.com/design/building-blocks/text-fields.html) are particularly confusing and seem to have conflicting examples in the guidelines compared to what I seen on my Nexus 7. Typographic heirarchy is the first step to making a complex set of information transferable for a broader audience. These styles need revision. If it’s confusing for the designer to layout controls then it’s definitely going to be confusing for the person using the application for the first time.

In a perfect world, I would convert all of [Tim Roes Android Photoshop Tools](https://github.com/timroes/android-ps-tools) into Sketch.app files. For now, they are the best I’ve come by for laying out standard UI controls. Good job, Tim! All in all, I’m missing the fluidity of working with artboards and gettings the bird’s eye view of a project. These are the benefits of working in Sketch.app or Illustrator – not to mention smaller file size.
