I did some bug fixing for the [VanCocoa](http://www.vancocoa.com) site today. We were having some rendering issues in Internet Exploder 9 (cough) – our targeted browser. It’s kinda odd we’re accommodating this technology for a [Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html) meet up because most attendees use good browsers. We got some support emails about the site not rendering on IE so we decided to meet the need.

I prowled around on the Internet in pursuit of an IE browser for Mac OSX Mountain Lion. There were many download sites that directed me to adds that preceeded download links. I stumbled across [Wine](http://wiki.winehq.org/MacOSX) and [Wine Bottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/). Both of these solutions didn’t work out for me because IE crashed upon opening. Sigh, FML, etc.. I wasn’t particularly excited to have this messy software ecosystem on my computer so I deleted my installs and ran [Clean My Mac](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac).

Today, I was reminded of how I like performance everything: cars, bicycles, phones, rice cookers – the list goes on. Shitty software doesn’t line up with my values. If you’re going to convert your bike to a single speed or fixed gear, the parts need to work with the frame. If they are not a good match, your ride is gonna suffer and you’re going to be disappointed.

Wine Bottler is a glimpse into a broken world.

I encourage anyone using a dated browser, to take that browser into a field and shoot it in the head. Uninstall and select one of these options:

<ul class="list">
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">FireFox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1531" taget="_blank">Safari</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/mac" target="_blank">Opera</a></li>
</ul>

If you don’t have access, petition your administrator. If your site is buggy on IE9, Nettuts+ has published a good article [9 Most Common IE Bugs and How to Fix Them](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/9-most-common-ie-bugs-and-how-to-fix-them/).
