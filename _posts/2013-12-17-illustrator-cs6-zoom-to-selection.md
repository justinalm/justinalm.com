I broke down and bought an [Adobe plugin](http://worker72a.com/pages/ZOOM.html) that enables ‘zoom to selection’ in Illustrator CS6. For $5 you can get a feature that should come with all Adobe Software. InDesign has this feature so why doesn’t Illustrator and Photoshop? Zooming to a selected element is the easiest way to navigate artboards. Having to zoom and scroll or select an area with the zoom tool is cumbersome. The fewer clicks and gestures the better. Unfortunately, the trend indicates Adobe is more focused on image processing features for Photoshop than delivering standardizing controls across all of their apps.

You can either spend $5 on [this plugin](http://worker72a.com/pages/ZOOM.html) or put the money toward purchasing [Sketch](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/sketch/id402476602?mt=12). It has ‘zoom to selection’ right out of the box. It’s only $70, is constantly improving, and is a pleasure to use. The support staff at [Bohemian Coding](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/) are super responsive and do there best to keep Sketch free of UI clutter while implementing new features. I feel like my designs look better when using Sketch. I draw with a simpler set of tools, which makes for more imaginative work, and there is a growing number of [template libraries](http://www.sketchappsources.com/). All this said, if you share documents between multiple people and you’re the sole user of Sketch, the $5 plugin might be your golden ticket to zoom efficiency.
