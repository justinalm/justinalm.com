I’ve been in a design sprint since Friday evening. Websites take a lot of time dressing before meeting the public. This site is in perpetual beta.

## The toolchain.

I’ve learned how to build with <a title="Inuit.scss on Github" href="https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/" target="_blank">Inuit.scss</a>. With Inuit, <a title="Compass Style Framework" href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a>, <a title="Wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a title="Starkers WordPress theme on Viewport Industries" href="http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/" target="_blank">Viewport Industries <em>Starkers</em></a>, and 1 week, this came to be. Video on this site is responsive because of <a title="Link to FitVids.js website" href="http://fitvidsjs.com/" target="_blank">FitVids.js</a>. For fonts, I’m running with Typekit. <a title="Link to Futura PT on Typekit" href="https://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt" target="_blank">Futura PT</a> by <a title="Link to ParaType on Typekit.com" href="https://typekit.com/foundries/paratype" target="_blank">ParaType</a> for headers, buttons, and nav list items. For body copy, I’m using <a title="Link to JAF FacitWeb" href="https://typekit.com/fonts/jaf-facitweb" target="_blank">JAF FacitWEb</a> by <a title="Just Another Foundry on Typekit.com" href="https://typekit.com/foundries/just-another-foundry" target="_blank">Just Another Foundry</a>. These fonts provide good contrast for screen at small and large sizes. I’ve been having an existential crisis choosing a CMS. My pride was pushing me toward <a title="Link to nanoc's homepage" href="http://nanoc.ws/" target="_blank">nanoc</a> and <a title="Link to Jekyll on Github" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> but I ended up building on WordPress.

## This website is mobile and tablet friendly.

I came to peace with this decision for several reasons. The <a title="Link to WordPress iOS App page" href="http://ios.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress iOS App</a> has come a long way in the past year. Knowing I can publish a project or blog post via my iPhone is an attractive feature for me. I didn’t want to be bogged down with routing config.rb files and other Ruby templating issues that arise when working with a static site compiler. I know all of my developer friends and mentors may think I’ve strayed into amateur darkness but I’ve come to peace with my decision. After building the <a title="Steamclock Software Website" href="http://www.steamclock.com" target="_blank">Steamclock Software</a> site using nanoc, I’ve realized, compromising a little on performance frees up time to focus on design and shipping faster. This site went from a ‘cloning’ inuit.scss to live in 1 week. My final reason for returning to PHP is <a title="Link to Trent Walton's website." href="http://trentwalton.com/" target="_blank">Trent Walton</a>. His site is a WordPress. No shame.

> Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

This thought from <em><a title="Dieter Rams: Ten principles of good design" href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design" target="_blank">Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design</a></em> is the form–driver for my new direction. Design is the heartbeat. I want this site to foster dialogue and hopefully make people stop and think differently about the world around us. I’ll be posting about technology, theory, UI/UX, patterns, concepts, and various topics of design and development. I’ve taken time to style the comment form so you can share your opinion with ease and pleasure.
