There was an event management company is the space before we opened.

When we looked at the space, there were bars up on the windows, bad office furniture was kicking around, and the walls were red. We saw potential, even though it was tucked away and needed a bit of TLC.

We brought it back to blank canvas. Things already looked better.

We built some racks, painted some light fixtures, and installed some signage. We wanted to make the place feel like we owned it.

We decided we needed a fitting room so I sketched it up and built it.

We feel great about how things turned out and wish we asked for a few months free rent. The space has been transformed.
