Does Samsung think consumers are stupid?

With the Samsung Gear, you can live like a spy. A short list of things you can do with this smart watch include:

<ul class="list">
	<li>take phone numbers by recording voices</li>
	<li>inconspicuously take pictures</li>
	<li>control music on your phone while drinking wine on the deck of an alpine chalet</li>
</ul>

I’m not sure who is the marketing director for Samsung’s products. Their ad for the Samsung EVO SSD is an eye roller.
