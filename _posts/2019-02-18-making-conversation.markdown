        <p>We learn about how Vince and Alvin met in “jail” and struggle to define ‘work’ as graphic designers. Alvin’s grandmother doesn’t understand his occupation. They tell us how they name their typefaces and how some of their fonts are unfortunately used. We learn about the conception of Commute App; Alvin doesn’t know the name of our podcast and Studio Faculty ranks #1 on Google for.</p>

        <p>Kriza is a designer, art director, ad-person, publication designer, and founder of Trim Projects. She doesn’t know where she’s from and neither does Shawn. Shawn just applied for Canadian citizenship, so he has to tone down his jokes.</p>

        <p>Karston Smith is a graphic designer and more at LuLuLemon. We talk about getting building permits at City Hall and how wack their yellow highlighters are. We come to the conclusion that when you’re learning something you’re interested in, learning isn’t painful. Justin realizes Sketch.app is great for UI design but not architectural drawings. We talk about acronyms, doing redneck things, design process at LuLuLemon, kombucha, crazy things yogis say, the art and design scene in Calgary, Karston’s art practice, and his upcoming exhibition.</p>

        <p>We sat down with Peter Cocking in the beautiful studio of Greystone Books. We talked about Peter’s childhood passion for drawing comics and making mistakes as a junior designer. He told us tales of designing on the 1st generation Mac and being one of the first registered users of PageMaker. He revealed his inspiration for teaching, the experience teaching his first class, and how he classifies a good student. He let us know what it felt like to receive the Ian Wallace Award for Teaching Excellence. After he educated us on education, we talked shop and found out where exactly Peter is working, how he deals with clients, the pleasures and pains of design process, sexless typography, whether or not ebooks are capable of magic, his favourite screen fonts, discontent, and how he would like to be remembered.</p>

        <p>We sat down with Jane Koo at the Making Conversation Studio. We talked about Jane’s childhood growing up in Seoul – surrounded by barf and protests. We talked about her first memories of design, how she submitted her portfolio to get into design school, and how she set out for a career. She told us how she worked as an in-house designer at Lush Cosmetics and came to the conclusion that she needed to move on. We talked about travelling back-and-forth between Vancouver and South Korea and solutions for dealing with jet-lag. Jane shared about her new found freedom in freelance, the joy of working on the road, the importance of style, her passion for food, and the one project she feels most proud of in her portfolio. Jane designs for some of Vancouver’s most iconic publications and community events.</p>

        <p>For Episode 8, we chat with Tom Chung, a designer working for <a href="http://www.umbra.com/">Umbra</a>, a Toronto-based homeware design company. He is the creative lead of their product line <a href="http://www.umbrashift.com/">Umbra Shift</a> that will be launching in Vancouver August 5th, 2014, at <a href="http://vanspecial.com/">Vancouver Special</a>. We talked about Tom’s childhood growing up in the Vancouver neighbourhood of Kitsilano; his adolescent interest in architecture and working for <a href="http://www.camposleckie.ca/">Campos Leckie</a>; when he realized industrial design was actually a ‘thing’ and his industrial design education at <a href="http://www.ecuad.ca/">Emily Carr University</a>. Tom shared with us about how he hyped himself on the Internet while battling the flu, leaving Vancouver to work in Toronto, and the difference between the Toronto and Vancouver art and design scenes. We spent the second half of our chat talking about Umbra. We talked Umbra Shift and got the low down on Tom’s two week sourcing adventure through Vietnam, Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. He dished details on how they selected designers to work on the collaboration. We also talked about the trials and tribulations of getting the booth setup at the <a href="http://www.icff.com/">International Contemporary Furniture Fair</a>(ICFF) and how it felt to win the Editor’s Award for Accessories.</p>
