> The notion of making something different is inherently flawed. There is difference by design and there is difference by request. The kind of difference you’re seeing now is one analysts and bloggers are requesting because they think they know Apple needs to be different. The kind of difference that matters is the difference that has been _considered_. It’s the kind of difference you see when…Apple came out with the first iPhone…the kind of difference you want to achieve because you know you can do something better than what exists. That’s the difference that matters.
