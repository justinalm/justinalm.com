I’m not sure what to make of Snapchat’s recent rejection of Facebook’s $3 billion dollar offer. What kind of a company turns down an offer for 3 billion? This news sparked some discussion amongst the team at Steamclock Software. You have to respect a company that isn’t interested in selling and I’m assuming _pride in product_ is what motivated Snapchat to look at all of those zeros and say, “no”. On the otherhand, I feel like if you had one good idea for an app there must be other apps you’d like to work on. It’s not like $3 billion wouldn’t give you and everyone in the company the money to get another product up and running – with the most badass design, development, and marketing campaign. Is time-limited photo sharing that important for the world? Maybe the thought of all that money made the Snapchat team feel a tinge of depression. There would be no more struggle. No more worry about success. No more tension of building and maintaining a product. We can all do the math and see the interest on that cake would print money.

A few months ago, I gave Snapchat a test ride but eventually lost interest. My first impression was that the UI was goofy and bad (in a good way). It’s refreshing to use a piece of software that doesn’t take itself seriously. Everything about the company seems _bad to be good_. What’s with the clown colours, the fat ghost icon, wrapping paper background patterns, the cartoon camera button, the gridless time picker? I’m not saying I don’t like it but I feel like this is definitely _design for delight_. Wacky, sarcastic, hipster, teen dazed delight.

In the end, I felt like it was another social network I had to invest in to get value out of. How do I invest with fleeting moments? After loosing my spark to snap and chat, I eventually stopped opening the app, it was dumped it in my collection of apps I never used, and then deleted during a purge. After Facebook’s offer, I felt like I had to go back and see what makes this product worth a $3 billion offer. I’m still wondering…
