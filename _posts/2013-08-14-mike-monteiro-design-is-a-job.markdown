I was pleased to find a copy of [Mike Monteiro’s](https://twitter.com/Mike_FTW) [Design Is A Job](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) on my desk after returning from our 4 day vacation in the [Okanagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okanagan). If this book is anything like Mike’s Creative Mornings talk *[Fuck You. Pay Me](https://vimeo.com/22053820)*, I am going to enjoy reading this. Working at [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com) is awesome!
