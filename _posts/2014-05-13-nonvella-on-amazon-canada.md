I take great satisfaction in seeing a product reach cruising altitude. [Grey Vaisius](http://greyvy.com/) and I have been honored to help the good people at Nonvella actualize _their_ vision for _their_ company. Sometimes design work stays in a gray zone and I start wonder if it will every see the light of day. After a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2017329183/nonvella-publishing-short-books-big-stories), the work we did over a year ago has become part of reality and supreme non-fiction is available from a forward-thinking publisher based in Vancouver, Canada.

##Nonvellaism By Nonvella

> Nonvella publishes non-fiction stories and essays by award-winning and emerging non-fiction writers. As a curated, boutique imprint, we’re after substance — __substance with style. Writers with strong voices. Vivid narratives. Life-sized questions and big ideas.__

> Nonvellas are bigger than journalism: often personal, hopefully perennial, sometimes controversial. But always concise. Between five and twenty thousand words, the longest can be read in under two hours.

> For writers, we are a new way to bring their work to readers — timely publishing with a fair split. We are a digital publisher first, but we aim to be deeper than digital. We help writers build relationships with readers beyond digital and print sales, and we offer new, profitable ways for writers and readers to derive satisfaction from their works.

> To that end, we’re partnering with groups and events — in our home base of Vancouver for now, but more cities to come — to get readers and writers off the page and at the same table. Stay tuned.

_— Tyee Bridge and Anne Casselman._

You want captivating writing? Here’s the blurb for [The Silicon Rapture](http://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Rapture-Encounters-Intelligence-Singularity-ebook/dp/B00KA1PIIS/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400004929&sr=1-2&keywords=nonvella):

> Will our children be ‘uploaded’ into digital immortality in the next 30 years? Could a rogue artificial intelligence burst into near-omniscience and take over the world? 

> According to some academics and Silicon Valley visionaries—among them artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer and Google director of engineering Ray Kurzweil—the answer is: maybe. 

> On the heels of the apocalyptic AI film Transcendence, and Stephen Hawking's May 2014 op-ed warning of the dangers of AI, this first release by Nonvella Publishing follows author Adam Pez into the big, weird questions of the Singularity: a predicted and possibly inevitable future when humanity and AI fuse into an entity of godlike proportions. 

> What is Singularity University, and what is the Machine Intelligence Research Institute? Should we applaud the time and money both are pouring into their respective projects, or should we proclaim "war to the death" against intelligent machines, as Samuel Butler urged us 150 years ago? 

> In this captivating read Pez introduces the history (and potential future) of AI, meets with the inventor of RoboCup, and sifts visionaries from crackpots on his quest to understand the meaning and likelihood of a ‘silicon rapture.’
