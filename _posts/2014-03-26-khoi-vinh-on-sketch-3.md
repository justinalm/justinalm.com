> I almost want to say that having symbols available in a vector application that has the precision of a raster application has changed the way I do design, but I don’t think that’s quite right. It’s more accurate to say that having symbols makes Sketch an even closer match for how I would think about manipulating graphical objects — period.

> In fact, I think that is the reason Sketch has gained so much traction in so short a time, and in a market that has been dominated for so long and in so thorough a fashion by Adobe. It’s true that Sketch probably could not have happened a decade ago; Bohemian Coding is clearly benefiting from lots of prior art, and from today’s powerful hardware and a very mature software ecosystem. But in my view their success is really predicated on bringing to bear a genuinely insightful understanding of how real people want to use graphics software.

Having “symbols” in Sketch may be the last straw for me and Illustrator. I see a purchase of [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) in my future and I’ll be done with the CS Suite for all of my personal projects.
