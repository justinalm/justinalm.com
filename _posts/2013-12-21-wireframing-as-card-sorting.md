The design process is constantly changing. I wrote a little about my process of wireframing applications in a recent blog post about the [iOS 7 Wireframing Kit](http://justinalm.com/ios-7-wireframing-kit.html). It’s been another week and I’ve continued to develop my process.

I started to work on a new project this week. I planned the user journey map using [MindNode Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mindnode-pro/id402398561?mt=12) and then produced the individual artboards in [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). I created each view as quickly and organically – trying to sketch as many views in as short a time as possible to  make lateral progress visualizing the project. When in this phase of the project, I’m reminding myself, “Rough is good.”

To speed up layout, I used the Teehan and Lax [iOS 7 GUI for Sketch](http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/iphone-sketch-app). I tried not to get hung up on keeping my Sketch file organized or filename details when exporting image files. As I thought of another view, I just created an artboard and titled it using the language from my MindNode map. I’ve stopped including numbers in the titles of my artboards. The process of design is non-linear so why name my artboard files with something linear like a sequence of numbers. In the end, I exported the artboards as full-resolution PNG files into a directory.

As mentioned in [a previous blog post](http://justinalm.com/ios-7-wireframing-kit.html), to create the presentation document for our client, I use InDesign. I built a Steamclock template to present our wireframes that includes Master Pages, properly sized frames, object and type styles, that have appropriate proportions and hierarchy. When placing files into InDesign, dropping them from Finder using the thumbnail view seems to work well. When organizing 45 images into a logical sequence, it’s faster to scan artboards as thumbnails compared to reading file names. A deck of cards would be painful to organize if the cards only had text to describe each card.

As the InDesign document grows with annotations and the artwork is refined, the links in the InDesign file require updating. To do the updating, I would manually highlight all of the links in the list and click the “Update Links” icon at the bottom of the tab. After doing this a few dozen times, the process starts to feel laborious. Then I found “Update All Links” in the fly-out menu of the “Links” tab. This simple menu item automates a small step in the process but speeds up the cycles of iteration.

My heart beats for minimalism. Reducing the sequence of gestures to perform a simple task is good user experience.
