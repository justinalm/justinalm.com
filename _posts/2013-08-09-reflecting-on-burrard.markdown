On warm Summer evenings, Hans and I like strolling down Burrard toward the Vancouver Convention Centre. Tonight we realized, “This is our neighbourhood.” We chat about our day and enjoy reflections of architecture on architecture. The view of a warm sunset through cool Vancouver glass was particularly inspiring. The Northern [Random Access Memories](http://www.randomaccessmemories.com/) vibe.
