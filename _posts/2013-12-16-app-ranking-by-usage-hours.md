Will Hains has [a good idea](http://willhains.com/post/69933018153/end-app-store-ratings) for dealing with the bad user experience ‘rate my app’ alerts create on iOS:

> Apple could, in theory, collect anonymous usage time statistics whenever the device checks the App Store for updates. Aggregate these to get the total number of hours that all the users of an app have spent, collectively, using the app. Then rank apps in the Store by their total usage time. No star ratings needed — but more importantly, no action needed by the customer at all.
