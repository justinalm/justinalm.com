<p class="image-caption">The Home Depot advertisement that appeared in my Facebook news feed.</p>

We bought a few tiles at Home Depot earlier today and I opted for the receipt to go to my email address. Now I get ads in my news feed on Facebook with flooring ideas from Home Depot. The email I use to log in to Facebook is not the address I gave for the emailed receipt. The algorithm thinks that because we bought a few tiles we’re going to be in the market to buy more. Somehow they connected the dots between my email address and my profile on Facebook. This stinks. Little do they know we aren’t getting ready to tile an entire floor.

## Update

Allen Pike asked me if I had gone on the Home Depot website before going to the store. I did. I wanted to check which store had the tiles to save time running around Vancouver. Apparently, this is how I got targeted on Facebook.
