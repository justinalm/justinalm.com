<p class="work-content"><a href="http://www.woo2cu.com" title="Link to woo2cu website" target="_blank">Woo To See You</a> needed a great online shopping experience that doubled as a platform to educate their customers about the brands they carry. Heirarchy of typogrpahy, scale of images, and layout of navigation were tested at various screen sizes during the design of the website. The constraints on this project were cost, pageload, and a minimalist shopping experience.</p>
