<p class="work-content"><a href="http://greyvy.com/" title="Grey Vaisius">Grey Vaisius</a> and I wrote a 130 page book about digital and analogue life. We called it <em>Know Ideas</em>. This project is a testimony that <em>working with others is more fun than working alone</em>. The book is trade size(9"x6"), which is a comfortable size to casually read. It features interactive spreads that depict web concepts. Some of these interactive features include: a page fold to hide/show information, French folds to illustrate back-end from front-end, layers of acetate that represent layers of web elements, and mirror paper â€” a poetic representation of the screen.</p>
