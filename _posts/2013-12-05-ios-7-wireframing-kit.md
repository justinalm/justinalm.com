I’m always looking for more efficient way to wireframe applications. Although I’ve started to wireframe our internal products in Sketch.app, we still use Illustrator for our client work. We’re currently working with a client that has a designer on their team so we need to use the same software. Adobe software is on the laptop of almost every designer. I’m a believer in designing UI according to the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](umentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/). To speed up the process of drawing wireframes, having a good wireframing kit is essential. The most recent kit I’ve downloaded and used is the [iOS 7 Wireframe Kit](http://blakeperdue.com/ios7-wireframe-kit/) by [Blake Perdue](https://github.com/blakeperdue). He’s done a great job of pooling the standard iOS 7 icons and common views found in an application. Every element in the kit is sizes according to the HIG for iOS. It’s also great because it’s not styled up like other kits that may look flashy but the visual language of the kit distracts the reader from thinking about interactions. I wireframe individual views on separate art boards and then save the Illustrator document as a PDF.

For small to mid-sized applications, there are usually 30 – 45 views that need to be considered. To bring artwork into a presentable state, I have setup an InDesign document with section headers and footers, media frames, paragraph and character styles, and gesture icons with object styles. This InDesign document contextualizes the art boards exported from Illustrator. After everything is annotated and organized, it gets exported from InDeisgn and shared out with the Steamclock crew and the client for feedback.
