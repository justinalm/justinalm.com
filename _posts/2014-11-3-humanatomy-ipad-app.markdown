At Steamclock Software, I designed the [Humanatomy iPad app](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/329391971/the-fun-way-to-master-human-anatomy-humanatomy) â€“ an innovative, fun and interactive game for learning the human body by [Humanatomy](http://humanatomy.ca/). The game has multiple levels full of amazing images. Anatomy artwork by [Clint Morris](http://www.morclintart.com/).
