We added Emily Carr University's [The Show 2013](http://theshow2013.ecuad.ca/) app and site to [Steamclockâ€™s portfolio page](http://www.steamclock.com/portfolio). We worked with [Seven25 Typography & Design](http://seven25.com/) and [Emily Carr](http://www.ecuad.ca) to design and develop an app to streamline the submission process, make curation easy, and deliver content in beautiful layouts accessible through desktops, tablets, and phones. It feels great to stay connected to the alma mater.
