Everyday I show up for work and open Harvest, HipChat, Messages, Twitter, Reminders, Mail, Sketch, various Adobe products, Rdio, and GitHub. After each application loads, I spend several minutes aligning all the windows into place. I like having Messages, HipChat, Twitter, Harvest, and Terminal windows stacked on top of each other and aligned to the right edge of my screen. My browser windows, iA Writer, GitHub client, and Sublime Text 2 get aligned to the left. I maximize all of my asset making tools like Sketch and Adobe products. Xcode gets maximized as well. As I’m using so many applications throughout my day, I like knowing where the windows will be when I tab between them. It is extremely frustrating when I switch to a program and I don’t find things where I left them. My tedious window aligning days are over thanks to Cordless Dog’s product [Stay](http://cordlessdog.com/stay/).
