I’ve been having problems with Layer Comps in Photoshop CS6. Elements, layer styles, and visibility do not save properly. The problem has been around for a while and it looks like Adobe hasn’t done anything to rectify the situation in Creative Cloud (See [this thread on Adobe Forums](http://forums.adobe.com/thread/1170951) as evidence for this gripe). This is embarrassing when sending files to clients for review.

<p class="image-caption">Which do you prefer? Why are the engineers getting the short end of the stick?</p>

When digging around the Internet for a solution to this problem, I noticed the difference between StackExchange’s [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Graphic Design](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/). I like the look of the _Graphic Design_ site and I’m wondering why the _Stack Overflow_ site doesn’t have the same ‘quality’ of design.
