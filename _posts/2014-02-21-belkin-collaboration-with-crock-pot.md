Yesterday I listened to [Episode 176: Everyday Automation](http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/02/09/mac-power-users-176-everyday-automation/) by the [Mac Power Users](http://www.macpowerusers.com/). They had a fairly in depth discussion of the WeMo sensors by Belkin. Down the page on the [WeMo page](http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/home-automation/c/wemo-home-automation/) of the Belkin site, I noticed they had a collaboration with Crock-Pot. Hans and I have been getting into slow cooking. Iâ€™m getting visions of starting my slow cooker while designing a user interface for an up and coming iOS app.
