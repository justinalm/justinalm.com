> The new address system based on road names took full effect starting January 1, 2014. Under this new system, all official documents submitted to public institutions such as birth certificates, marriage registration forms and residency documents must use the newly implemented street address system based upon street names and building numbers. Mail sent using old addresses will still be delivered and no penalties will be charged for using the old system. The Korean government has been making efforts to make the road name address system official since 2011. The new system provides more benefits in the long run by simplifying the address and making it more consistent.

I see headaches in the future for South Korean mail carriers because the government is allowing people to address their mail using two systems.
