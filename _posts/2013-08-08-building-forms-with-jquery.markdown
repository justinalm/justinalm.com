I did some work today building a settings view for an admin site. This view will control the settings of an iOS app we’re building for a client at Steamclock. I was able to get the fieldsets cloning on the click of the “+ Add New Rate” button and removing from the page on the click of each clone’s “Delete” button. Seeing a page come alive with javascript is addictive. Check out the video below.
