At Steamclock Software, we redesigned Mozilla’s [Stumbler Android app](https://location.services.mozilla.com/apps). People use Stumbler to help develop [Mozilla’s Location Services](https://location.services.mozilla.com/). To incentify participation, we designed an app that gamifies data collection. The app is still in production.
