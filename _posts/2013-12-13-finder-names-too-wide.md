I have an issue with Finder defaults in Mavericks. The ‘Name’ portion of my Finder window is always too wide and creates an annoying horizontal scroll. I’ve read through the [Apple discussion threads](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5499589) and checked out possible options to remedy the situation. Nothing has come up that looks like a good solution for this problem. Apple, I would greatly appreciate an update with a fix for this issue.
