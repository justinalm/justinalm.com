<p class="work-content">With the crew at Steamclock Software, I work on information architecture, wireframing, front-end development (web only), and visual design for the 2013 Emily Carr Graduation Exhibition website and iPad app. For students, the site includes a submission form to walk through the process of submitting a project to the catalog. For curators, the site includes an admin panel to review submissions, approve projects to “go live”, or request revisions to a project so it can be resubmitted.</p>

<p class="work-content">The Node.js back end was engineered by Angelina Fabbro, the front-end for the iPad app was engineered by Nigel Brooke, and the project was managed by Allen Pike. Artwork included in the app icon and user interface was sourced from <em>The Show</em> brand by <a href="http://www.seven25.com/" title="Seven25 Design" target="_blank">Seven25 Design</a>.</p>
