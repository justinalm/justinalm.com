I spent some time today designing an invoice for Woo To See You. We wanted a receipt that we can easily add products to, recalculates the subtotal, taxes(PST and GST), and grand total of the bill. Also, Pages enables us to easily share a PDF copy to our customer via the Mac Mail client. Finally, no more fumbling around with a calculator, pen, and carbon copy receipt booklet.
