<!-- ![The Jekyll Logo](/images/jekyll-logo@2x.png "The Jekyll Logo") -->

During my design education at Emily Carr, I learned a lot about the laws of design. I was told, “Foundries don’t come after students for using unlicensed fonts because lawsuits against students aren’t profitable.” As the end of my degree approached and I was thinking about jobs, Celeste Martin told me, “Hoefler & Frere-Jones won’t give you an interview if they spot any unlicensed copies of their fonts in your portfolio.” Thankfully, I didn’t stray far from the Adobe Font Folio during my degree. I could’ve interviewed with a clear conscience at H&FJ but I had bigger fish to fry – I needed to get my wife back onto Canadian soil.

All this said, I’ve got a short-list of fonts I’d like to legally work with some day. The reality is, many of my favourite fonts have yet to make to the web so the chances of them making into the Adobe Creative Cloud are slim.
