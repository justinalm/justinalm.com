Yesterday, Steamclock got the Nexus 7 as a test device. This latest version of the tablet is lighter, thinner, has a better display, and is made of higher quality materials. The tablet is an example of good intentions that got botched by a couple of bad hardware decisions. Android OS aside, here are the two reasons why I won’t be ordering a Nexus 7.

## The Front Facing Camera
The front-facing camera is off-center to the right. It feels awkward and even though I haven’t had the opportunity to video chat with someone using the device, I can imagine the UX will be similar to FaceTime on the desktop.

## Matte Plastic Back
My biggest usability problem with this device is the matte finish of the plastic on the back. It looks nice and feels soft at first use but once you sit down and start reading for a while, the tablet slides in your hands. I want the tablet to rest in my hands. Do you want to read on a tablet that is constantly sliding to the floor?
