For my latest work on WeddingDJ, I’ve been designing in <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank" title="Sketch for Mac">Sketch</a>. One of my favourite features of Sketch is to go back on work and aligned it to the pixel grid. This feature, combined with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch-mirror/id677296955?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank" title="Sketch Mirror for iOS">Sketch Mirror</a>, gives me assurance that my UI will not look fuzzy.

If you’re using Sketch and you want to get your pixels back on the grid, use “Round to Nearest Pixel Edge” in the Edit menu.
