# About me

## Overview

I’m from Vancouver, Canada. I enjoy helping businesses grow by crafting delightful experiences.

For the past 8+ years, I‘ve lead design on several cross-platform product teams, as well as identity, marketing, sales, and customer success projects.

I have experience designing products for iOS, Android, and web apps, marketing websites and ads, digital and print publications, end-to-end retail, press kits, exhibitions, and presentations.

# ECUAD

While attending the Interaction Design Degree Program at Emily Carr University of Art + Design, I worked for the Social and Interactive Media (SIM) Centre and Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) Center during my 3rd and 4th years.

The SIM Centre opened up opportunities for me to work with Mozilla, Steamclock Software, and other ECUAD faculty and students.

At the S3D Centre, I conducted interviews, produced graphics for articles, and published interviews to the research centre blog.

I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for Nintendo of America, large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for Park Royal Shopping Centre, advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver’s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for Marketplace Events – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.

# Steamclock Software

At Steamclock Software, my work involved strategy, information architecture, wireframing, user interface design, branding, and marketing for app on iOS and Android.

Half of my time at Steamclock was spent designing the products WeddingDJ and PartyMonster. The other half of my time was spent designing various iOS, Android, and web products for clients.

I cut my teeth in product design and front-end development. Steamclock gave me the freedom to take risks, learn, and evolve my process. Company and employee benefitted from that trust.
