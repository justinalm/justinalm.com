## __Acetate__

Metaphorical representation of the "body" using a layer of acetate over Michelangelo’s David. Common elements found in the body of a web page map to the human body.

Lift the acetate to see the body innocently – as you saw it before gaining consciousness.

## __Mirror paper__

The mirror screen. The screen is a reflection of the self.

Explorations around why we are captivated by the screen, the Internet, and conciousness.

## __French folds__

Open the French fold to find hidden meaning. The Internet is a grand expression of life.

## __Gate folds__

Language influeces you to interact with the page. The full meaning is found in the interaction.
