## __Intro__

At Steamclock Software, we consulted with <a href="http://www.wipfactory.com/" target="_blank">WIP Factory</a> on the design and development of <a href="http://www.wipfactory.com/blog/2016/4/1/from-the-devmonitor-what-do-stack-overflows-survey-results-say-to-dev-programs" target="_blank">Devmonitor.io</a>. The app enables you to track and respond to questions about your product on sites like Stackoverflow and Github.

To remove questions from the feed, click the “x” icon in the top-right corner of the item. To reply to a question, click the reply-icon below the relevance score in the top-left corner of the item.

## __Analytics__

Analytics enables you to gauge developer sentiment about your product. Each of your selected keywords corresponds to a colour on the charts. We built this view leveraging <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Charts.js</a>.
