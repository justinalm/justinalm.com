    <h2><a id="A_blog_with_lots_of_legacy_5"></a>A blog with lots of legacy</h2>
    <p>In 2015, The Jostle Blog moved from our self-hosted WordPress to Marketo. About a year later, the blog moved from Marketo to HubSpot. To close the deal with Jostle, HubSpot‚Äôs developers replicated our site on their platform. A clever sales move that wins over non-technical marketing people.</p>
    <img src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/cms-jumping.jpg" alt="WordPress to Marketo to HubSpot">
    <p>Needless to say, the blog was jumping from CMS to CMS with the intention of improving our marketing efforts. In the process, the user experience was getting kicked around. We kept migrating the site without investing time and energy into understanding how to execute design on the new platform. This was partially a breakdown in communication within our team and partially the reality that our design team was swamped product needs.</p>
    <p>Over the years, hundreds of articles were being publishing into crufty layouts. Our writers wanted their words presented in the best way possible but no one wanted to bother the design team with another request. Our readers suffered with some janky experience and our content marketing efforts weren‚Äôt as effective as they could be.</p>
    <h2><a id="Design_started_with_a_need_17"></a>Design started with a need</h2>
    <p>June 2018, Corey Moseley joined Jostle as a Content Marketing Specialist. Corey writes and publishes 2 articles a week. We started to notice some serious visitor numbers on the blog. One of the benefits of fresh eyes arriving in your company is they enquire about things. Here‚Äôs a paraphrased version of the chat Corey and I had on <a href="https://www.jostle.me/">Jostle</a>‚Äîhow all of this work began:</p>
    <p><strong>Corey</strong>: I have a ~special project~ in mind, but it‚Äôs by no means a priority. I was thinking that the blog masthead could use a new look. What do you think?<br>
    <strong>Justin</strong>: The blog masthead does feel like it needs some love. It‚Äôs been that way for years. I‚Äôd be down to take on the work.<br>
    <strong>Corey</strong>: Nice. I don‚Äôt really like any of our competitors‚Äô blog mastheads. They all just have ‚ÄúThe Intranet Blog‚Äù over a stock photo. [YIKES!]<br>
    <strong>Justin</strong>: Yeah. Our competitors are not inspiring. [Such is the nature of the intranet marketplace]. I would like to redesign of the entire blog. It‚Äôs pretty jank. In the listings pages, it would be great to showcase bigger images and ditch those big ass read more links.<br>
    <strong>Corey</strong>: Agreed. That‚Äôs a much larger project though, right?<br>
    <strong>Justin</strong>: Yup.<br>
    <strong>Corey</strong>: Let me run this by Dustin [Director of Growth Marketing] and see what he thinks.<br>
    <strong>Justin</strong>: I‚Äôm going to layup some ideas and we‚Äôll see where things go.</p>
    <p>Obviously, Dustin gave the project the go ahead. I mean, that‚Äôs why <em>this</em> case study exists. üòâ I‚Äôd like to note that Corey came to me with a desire to improve the masthead on the blog but we dug a little deeper and decided to tackle a more pervasive problem, which would benefit all of our visitors.</p>
    <h2><a id="Scope_32"></a>Scope</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>‚ÄúUnbox‚Äù our content and do a better job showcase our writing, illustration, and brand</li>
    <li>Make it easier for our readers to respond to articles</li>
    <li>Remove clutter and distractions to provide a better reading experience (i.e. social sharing widgets, subscription pop-ups, etc.)</li>
    <li>Tastefully give visitors the opportunity to read more from our resources, popular articles, newer or older content</li>
    <li>Improve subscribing for updates</li>
    <li>Offer links to jostle.me‚Äîour home base for marketing our product</li>
    <li>Make it easier for our marketing team to publish articles (i.e. fewer fields and checkboxes to manage to publish and article)</li>
    <li>Bring the design of the blog in-line with The Jostle Style Guide to increase cohesion across our marketing assets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following is a teardown of what we changed.</p>
    <h2><a id="Global_nav_44"></a>Nav</h2>
    <p>We removed the large masthead. We added a unique ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù link beside the Jostle logo to provide context for visitors to know where they are. This also gave us the ability to keep the Jostle logo as a link to jostle.me and also provide a link to the blog index.</p>
    <p>In an effort to connect blog visitors to jostle.me, we added links to our Product and Resources pages. The CTA to ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù had similar proportions to the search input so we repositioned it as a link in the nav. We then widened the search input and moved it to the right.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Listing_pages_62"></a>Listing pages</h2>
    <p>For the listings pages, I changed the design to use our 16x9 featured images, which are used in the header of the article design. This way, we no longer needed a secondary, small, square asset.</p>
    <p>I added variation to the layout of the to the listings pages in an effort to make it more engaging. These larger and smaller article summaries enabled us to focus attention to recent articles, down the list of previous articles, and highlight other useful resources and popular articles without pulling too much attention from blog content.</p>
    <p>I also designed a variant for articles that don‚Äôt have images, which features big type for the titles. This gives articles without images equal presence to articles with images.</p>
    <p>I also restyled the pagination so they aligned with The Jostle Style Guide‚Äîmaking them easier to read and tap.</p>
    <p>Jostle uses Open Sans across all of our brand touchpoints. I added Open Sans Condensed for the titles on the blog, which provides a few more characters per line and better wrapping.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Articles_69"></a>Articles</h2>
    <p>I added a back to blog button to the top-left corner of the article so people always have a clear path back to the listings page. I split the top fold of article so you see the title, summary, metadata, and image above the fold. I improved the styling of the author credit at the top of the article so it‚Äôs consistent with the styling at the bottom of the article. I also generally improved the sizing, colours, and spacing of the author credit so it adheres to our style guide.</p>
    <p>We removed Sumo share buttons that floated on the left-hand side of the page, which didn‚Äôt get clicked, showed low engagement counts, and were distracting when reading. To still offer people a way to share on social media, I added social buttons top-right. I also added the ‚ÄúShare this‚Äù component bottom-right for when you‚Äôre done reading.</p>
    <p>We added a field to the article editor for ‚ÄúImage Credit‚Äù so people know which Jostle Designer created the art for the article. I styled the  social media buttons more subtle so they didn‚Äôt compete with our branding, illustrations, and content. I also improved the interaction of these buttons so sharing is a little more fun.</p>

    <h2><a id="Footer_53"></a>Footer</h2>
    <p>We styled the footer to be more consistent with <a href="http://jostle.me">jostle.me</a>. We also shortened the copyright and trademark noticed and moved the subscription form from the bottom of each article into the footer. When you click on ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù in the header nav, you are scrolled down to the form in the footer, which is then outlined with a subtle marquee effect so you don‚Äôt miss it in the journey.</p>
