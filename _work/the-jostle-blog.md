        <p class="u-noMargin" style="max-width: 100%;">January of 2019, I redesigned and developed <a href="https://blog.jostle.me">The Jostle Blog</a> with the intention of giving our visitors a better reading experience. We also improved the navigation, search, and commenting UX.</p>

<div class="Grid Grid--withGutters  mw-600  u-mar-auto">
    <div class="Grid-cell">
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>Added Open Sans Condensed to the Typekit so that we can fit a few more characters into each headline and improve the line wrap.</p>
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Removed large masthead and added the “Blog” link to the header so we you can navigate to <a href="http://Jostle.me">Jostle.me</a> or to the root of the blog.</li>
            <li>In an effort to connect visitors to the blog to our <a href="http://Jostle.me">Jostle.me</a> resources, we added a link to Resources.</li>
            <li>Made “Subscribe a link so the CTA was competing with the styling of the search input.</li>
            <li>Improved width of the Search input as it used to have proportions that were very close to button.</li>
            <li>Added a clear back to blog button in the top-left corner of the Article and Author pages so people can get back to the index easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cleaned up the footer and made it feel more consistent with our site. Shortened the copyright text.</li>
            <li>Moved the subscription form to the footer. Now, when you click on “Subscribe” in the nav, you are scrolled down to the subscribe form in the footer, which is highlighted so you notice it in the journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Index template</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>On the index, we use our full 16x9 assets from the article header so we no longer need excerpt images.</li>
            <li>There is more variation on the index page—making it more engaging and offering more content for people to dig into.</li>
            <li>Gave more presence to the most recent article so that if feels “featured”.</li>
            <li>Added variants for articles that don’t have images. The headlines are larger for articles without images so that they don’t loose presence to articles with images.</li>
            <li>Brought font-sizing and styling in line with our style guide.</li>
            <li>Added a right-sidebar with 4 pieces of content we can swap out from our Useful Resources (These were the top 4 visited Resource pages on <a href="http://Jostle.me">Jostle.me</a>). Also added 4 Popular articles to the right sidebar to surface other high traffic content.</li>
            <li>Restyled pagination buttons so they adhere to our style guide—making them easier to read and tap.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Article template</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Split the top fold of Articles so you see the Title, summary, and featured image above the fold.</li>
            <li>Improved styling of the author credit at the top of the article so it’s consistent with the styling at the bottom of the article. I also generally improved the sizing, colours, and spacing of the author credit so it adheres to our style guide.</li>
            <li>Added “Share this” social media buttons top-right, which also appear bottom-right for when you’re done reading too.</li>
            <li>Added field for image credit so our illustrators and designers get some love.</li>
            <li>Removed Sumo share buttons. There were many buttons that never got counts and these buttons were distracting when reading content and obscured content on the mobile.</li>
            <li>Made styling of social media buttons more subtle so they didn’t compete with our branding, illustrations, and content. I also improved the interaction of these buttons so sharing is a little more fun.</li>
            <li>Styled the comments form and threading so it’s sizing, spacing, and colours adhere to our style guide.</li>
            <li>Improved styling of the flash message people see after their comment has been submitted.</li>
            <li>Added a “Read more” section with links to the previous/next articles in the blog (based on publish date). This way, people can continue their journey in the blog after surfing in from a link on Google or another social channel.</li>
            <li>Improved the sizing, spacing, and colours of our CTAs at    the end of blog articles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Author page</h2>
        <p>Improved sizing and spacing of the avatar, title, and bio.</p>
        <h2>Content management</h2>
        <p>It’s now easier to post articles. We used to have multiple fields that needed to be entered: Post excerpt, Excerpt image, Featured image, meta description, etc… Now you only have to enter in the meta description and choose a featured image. Featured image is now optional.</p>
        <h2>Thoughts or questions?</h2>
