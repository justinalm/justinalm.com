    <h2><a id="A_blog_with_lots_of_legacy_5"></a>A blog with lots of legacy</h2>
    <p>In 2015, The Jostle Blog moved from our self-hosted WordPress to Marketo. About a year later, the blog moved from Marketo to HubSpot. To close the deal with Jostle, HubSpot‚Äôs developers replicated our site on their platform. A clever sales move that wins over non-technical marketing people.</p>
    <img src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/cms-jumping.jpg" alt="WordPress to Marketo to HubSpot">
    <p>Needless to say, the blog was jumping from CMS to CMS with the intention of improving our marketing efforts. In the process, the user experience was getting kicked around. We kept migrating the site without investing time and energy into understanding how to execute design on the new platform. This was partially a breakdown in communication within our team and partially the reality that our design team was swamped with product needs.</p>
    <p>Over the years, hundreds of articles were being publishing into crufty layouts. Our writers wanted their words presented in the best way possible but no one wanted to bother the design team with requests to make things better. Our readers suffered with some janky experience and our content marketing efforts weren‚Äôt as effective as they could be.</p>
    <h2><a id="Design_started_with_a_need_17"></a>The redesign started with a desire to make things better</h2>
    <p>June 2018, Corey Moseley joined Jostle as a Content Marketing Specialist. In addition to his other content duties, Corey writes and publishes 2 articles a week to the blog. A few months after Corey joined Jostle, we started to notice some serious visitor numbers on the blog. New coworkers bring a lot of benefits through asking tough questions and a willingness to make change happen.</p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs a paraphrased version of the chat Corey and I had on <a href="https://www.jostle.me/">Jostle</a>‚Äîthe place where our collective desire to make change happened:</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p><strong>Corey</strong>: I have a ~special project~ in mind, but it‚Äôs by no means a priority. I was thinking the blog masthead could use a new look. What do you think?</p>
    <p><strong>Justin</strong>: The blog masthead does need some love. It‚Äôs been that way for years. I‚Äôd be down to take on the work.</p>
    <p><strong>Corey</strong>: Nice. I don‚Äôt really like any of our competitors‚Äô blog mastheads. They all just have ‚ÄúThe Intranet Blog‚Äù over a stock photo. [YIKES!]</p>
    <p><strong>Justin</strong>: Yeah. Our competitors are not inspiring. [Such is the nature of the intranet marketplace]. I would like to redesign the entire blog. The whole thing is feeling dated and unconsidered. In the listings pages, it would be great to showcase bigger images and ditch those big-ass read more links.</p>
    <p><strong>Corey</strong>: Agreed. That‚Äôs a much larger project though, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Justin</strong>: Yup.</p>
    <p><strong>Corey</strong>: Let me run this by Dustin [Jostle‚Äôs Director of Growth Marketing] and see what he thinks.</p>
    <p><strong>Justin</strong>: I‚Äôm going to layup some ideas and we‚Äôll see where things go.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Obviously, Dustin gave the project the go ahead. I mean, that‚Äôs why <em>this</em> case study exists.üòâ I‚Äôd like to note that Corey came to me with a desire to improve the masthead on the blog but we dug a little deeper and decided to tackle a more pervasive problem, which improved the whole system‚Äîto the benefit of all of our visitors and the marketing team.</p>
    <h2><a id="Scope_32"></a>Vision and scoping</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>‚ÄúUnbox‚Äù our content and do a better job showcase our writing, illustration, and brand.</li>
    <li>Make it easier for our readers to respond to articles.</li>
    <li>Remove clutter and distractions to provide a better reading experience (i.e. social sharing widgets, subscription pop-ups, etc.).</li>
    <li>Tastefully give visitors the opportunity to read more from our resources, popular articles, newer or older content.</li>
    <li>Improve subscribing for updates.</li>
    <li>Offer links to jostle.me‚Äîour home base for marketing our product.</li>
    <li>Make it easier for our marketing team to publish articles (i.e. fewer fields and checkboxes to manage to publish and article).</li>
    <li>Bring the design of the blog in-line with The Jostle Style Guide to increase cohesion across our marketing assets.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Scope_32"></a>Design process</h2>
    <p>I followed a fairly predictable design process for the project. Starting with explorations in my sketchbook and in Figma. Taking those ideas through concept and design reviews with the broader team. Then building building up the site in HubSpot.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>Here‚Äôs a detailed teardown of each component that changed.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Global_nav_44"></a>Nav</h2>
    <p>We removed the large masthead. We added a unique ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù link beside the Jostle logo to provide context for visitors to know where they are. This also gave us the ability to keep the Jostle logo as a link to jostle.me and also provide a link to the blog index.</p>
    <p>In an effort to connect blog visitors to jostle.me, we added links to our Product and Resources pages. The CTA to ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù had similar proportions to the search input so we repositioned it as a link in the nav. We then widened the search input and moved it to the right.</p>
</div>

        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Listing_pages_62"></a>Listing pages</h2>
    <p>For the listings pages, I changed the design to use our 16x9 featured images, which are used in the header of the article. This way, we no longer needed a secondary, small, square asset. Less to prep, maintain, and mess up in the future.</p>
    <img class="u-mar-t05  u-mar-b05" src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/image-sizing.jpg" alt="Image sizing">
    <p>I added some variation to listings page to make them more engaging. These larger and smaller article summaries enabled us to focus attention on recent articles, then futher down the list of articles, and highlighting other useful resources and popular articles. The goal was to direct attention, increase awareness of other resources, without overloading the reader.</p>
</div>

<div class="Grid  Grid--withGutters">
    <div class="Grid-cell  u-size1of2">
        <figure>
            <img class="u-rounded-corners  u-shadow" src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/old-listing.jpg" alt="Old listing">

        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>I also designed a variant for articles without featured images, which features big type for the titles. This gives articles without images equal presence to articles with images.</p>

        <img class="u-rounded-corners  u-shadow" src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/alternate-layout.jpg" alt="Alternate layout">
        <figcaption>Layout for artricles without images</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I also changed the pagination so you can only page between older and newer listings. We used to offer an ‚ÄúAll‚Äù button that crashed your browser as it loaded 450 article summaries with images. For this reason, we offer search.</p>
    <figure class="u-textAlign-center  u-mar-t05">
        <img class="w-auto  u-rounded-corners  u-shadow" style="width: 241px;" src="/uploads/the-jostle-blog/new-pagination.jpg" alt="New pagination">

    </figure>
</div>


<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>Jostle uses Open Sans across all of our brand touchpoints. I added Open Sans Condensed for the titles on the blog, which provides a few more characters per line, better wrapping, and improved contrast from excerpts.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Articles_69"></a>Articles</h2>
    <p>I added a ‚ÄúBack to blog‚Äù button to the top-left corner so people always have a clear path back to the listings page. I split the top fold of article so you see the title, summary, metadata, and image above the fold. I improved the styling of the author credit at the top of the article so it‚Äôs consistent with the styling at the bottom of the article. I also generally improved the sizing, colours, and spacing of the author credit so it adheres to our style guide.</p>
    <p>We removed Sumo share buttons that floated on the left-hand side of the page, which didn‚Äôt get clicked, exposed low engagement numbers, and were a distraction while reading. We still needed to offer a way to share on social media so I added social buttons top-right and bottom-right for when you‚Äôre done reading.</p>
    <p>We added a field to the article editor for ‚ÄúImage Credit‚Äù so people know who created the featured image. We made the social buttons more subtle so they didn‚Äôt compete with the brand, illustrations, or content. I also improved the interaction of these buttons, making sharing a little more novel.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>I also added a an alternate layout for the article header for articles that don‚Äôt have a featured image.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>Comments and the comment form got restyled, improving hierarchy, font-size, spacing, colour, threading‚Äîall in adherence to our style guide.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>At the bottom of each article, I added ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù pagination with links to the previous/next articles in the blog (based on publish date). This enables the reader can discover more content after surfing to the blog from a link on Google or another social channel.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h2><a id="Author_listing_91"></a>Author listing</h2>
    <p>On the author pages, we improved the sizing and spacing of the avatar, title, and bio. In the old author page, the author‚Äôs avatar and bio resembled one of the blog posts in the list.</p>

    <h2><a id="Footer_53"></a>Footer</h2>
    <p>We styled the footer to be more consistent with our main marketing site. We shortened the copyright and trademark noticed and moved the subscription form here. It used to appear at the bottom of each article. When you click on ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù in the header nav, you are scrolled down to the form in the footer, which is then outlined with a subtle marquee effect so you don‚Äôt miss it in the journey.</p>
