    <h2><a id="Why_did_we_build_the_Style_Guide_4"></a>Why a style guide?</h2>
    <p>A style guide contains the rules and pieces of a system collected and codified in a single place. The <em>Jostle Style Guide (Style Guide)</em> originated with <a href="https://platform.jostle.us/jostle-prod/#~b~:5:1:2795:~p~:1:185326">Justin Alm</a>, <a href="https://platform.jostle.us/jostle-prod/#~b~:5:1:2795:~p~:1:191168">Grey Vaisius</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nheaney">Noel Heaney</a> and was created to meet the need to have a easy way to replicate and assemble consistent design deliverables. The Style Guide proved to be very useful for designers joining our team, as it empowered new designers to make more impactful decisions faster. It was a living system and we continued to improve its minor details and debated how to refine and extend it throughout my time at Jostle.</p>

    <p>As the number of people in our design team increased, our need for shared principles and rules for measuring the success of design also increased. We started with a set of extremely basic building blocks: colours, a defined and flexible typographic hierarchy, spacing units, and a few practical use elements (form elements, dividers, buttons, etc.).</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>We used a naming convention and methodology inspired by <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Brad Frosts‚Äô Atomic design</a>. This seemed like an extensible approach to us, allowing us to stop at a small set of building blocks (atoms) or logically expand to modules (molecules) and further into layouts (organisms) if we so required.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hSfuHVtKTYYGzNvv3usuRWcrSH0cznccRWIe_vuE3lRHhxLWP2obwYW3oaWcZjqlTAnu72mDd7LsOUqwaleZi_FFgZIlR-7vW3wHI-YqauHwEXLg97mYHBEJDMJsnqksX0XojFc" alt=""></p>
    <p>Having a single point of reference, to find answers to questions regarding style, enabled our team of independent people to conceptualize, design, and build products that felt like variations on a cohesive theme. When cohesion or integration issues arose, there was a clear point of reference to trace back to. This point could be modified or extended and all future projects benefited from the expansion. Our system became an entity in the organization and identifying and discussing inconsistencies became easier. The benefits of the Style Guide extended beyond our internal experience of designing and building products. As the principles and rules of our style guide were applied, the experience of people working with our products also became more consistent, stable, and enjoyable.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z-A7wlYUlF_L3SToocDqdS3Hkc-DM8e7KM0jV3E6SFl3xWfjQmQGxLDvnonuHMnkQ2fmfbsKaPRLt15P9yKzHK0u6ALEVQX89_WaPVUsT7S_g17K8caHc610swT2jYTwVB0deAU" alt="The many style guides you can see on styleguides.io"></p>
    <h2><a id="What_were_the_downsides_of_the_Style_Guide_29"></a>What were the downsides of the Style Guide?</h2>
    <p>Without total vertical integration, tracking changes from the Style Guide to all of the instances where stylistic rules were implemented, made for a less than perfect outcome. There are many ways to try and deal with this problem but everyone was always balancing cost vs benefit on the production pipeline. Since our Style Guide was not totally integrated into the development process, it required our UI Developer and QA Teams to know and understand font-sizes, spacing units, colours, and rules for form controls. All of that detailed information was the value proposition of the Style Guide in the first place.</p>
    <h2><a id="How_did_we_use_it_33"></a>How did we use it?</h2>
    <p>The Jostle Design Team (all of us) used the Style Guide to great effect. It allowed us to work independently and still achieve a high level of consistency. It allowed us to share a carefully considered and flexible system to design with. For example, figuring out how far 1 element should be from another element required less problem solving with a limited set of variables to choose from (5 possible choices in the case of the Style Guide üëç ). In fact, most UI components we designed, or were most often best designed, from a set of 3 or less spacing units, colours, line-qualities, and type sizes.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZSZJK1XBi9JOq8OivUesSsPmQRpCyi5LOuox0klDtxNei_eZheRdS2ImjFr27pQXGklQtpQByUSch51MN7_IKwy1kV3ItLwLYVfhTePQTpV2cz0I4PoPqjt8Fvmu7wuJcxS8lu0" alt="Iterating on large systems like Jostle‚Äôs Library app is a lot easier with our Style Guide"></p>
    <h2><a id="How_did_PMs_and_Developers_use_our_style_guide_40"></a>How did PMs and Developers use our style guide?</h2>
    <p>We called for everyone at Jostle to apply the rules of our Style Guide to their work. The more we designed and built according to the Style Guide, the faster we were able to move forward. The scope of questions regarding spacing, colours, font sizes, etc. were dramatically reduced. We were able to reach a consensus faster and have more time to do what we all wanted to do ‚Äì get deeper in the process so we could design and ship more awesome experiences.</p>
    <p>That enough of the conceptual background. Now you‚Äòre probably asking the question, what were the atomic elements we used?</p>
    <h2><a id="Elements_of_Jostles_Style_Guide_46"></a>Elements of Jostle‚Äôs Style Guide</h2>
    <h2><a id="Colour_47"></a>Colour</h2>
    <p>We primarily used 5 colours when designing new features, marketing pages, or other assets for other teams. These colours were pulled from the Jostle logo. We also included 5 shades of grey that were used to aid in building hierarchy within a view.</p>
    <p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_3579122CE10EDD8805147178FCEB8448541A4C0CA8C54D80148E52B25F55C030_1548139738885_Screen+Shot+2019-01-21+at+10.48.38+PM.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>After we rollout our ‚Äú<em>extraordinary workplaces</em>‚Äù identity, we extended our 5 primary colours to enable more expression when producing blog images, online ads, and gated content pieces. We considered it best practice to constrain new designs to the primary colour palette and we tried to use the extended palette only when needed. Although we initially extended the colours for use on the marketing website, these new colours proved to be useful for product design as well.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Cy2hm6k-nfs_lzJPJolxw31Iu65bc6SPV8dXZnBkXAoYlEbJbZzvUzIEU17zIWUJWGScua71FYeQXhEGMY_UsAnzyW8vZAP_JmcoDXG3uzB8y4PL7T_5yaZ9sC-OGMYTL1CEQ4s" alt="The extended palette of darker colours we used in our marketing collateral"></p>
    <p>We used our palette of greys to bring focus within a Primary View. The view hierarchy moved from left to right and dark to light. There were instances when we had to break the rules of ‚Äúdark-to-light‚Äù to maintain contrast within a view. This was especially true when styling our product according to some of our customer brands.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RNnNy_-W5F4uyoKjy56tIefomc2nJTJsgrrC5PIYuzPFI0EbK1Zy6QqjeY2vi83QI9ElLnqFa4otd7zYCo2c8usYHRovUhlgwxK2xG1fHLYFYj8v3rNtd0D7oo0qkSZovXnEYe8" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Typography_66"></a>Typography</h2>
    <p>Within most of the product and marketing materials, we used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a> by Steve Matteson. Open Sans is optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. We used the Regular (400), Regular Italic (400), Bold (700), and Bold Italic (700) weights in our application UI.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, we used larger or bolder sized type to indicate a new section of content or controls. For example, the font size for a title of a form was styled larger than the font size of an input label. The the largest type in our application was 32px and the smallest was 12px. By default, headers were regular weight but could be made bold. Most type within the UI was set at font-size of 14px with a line-height of 1.6 because that font-size struck a balance between legibility and efficient use of screen real estate. For longform reading, such as chat Timelines and the body of an Article, Event, or Classified, we used font-size: 16px to improve the reading experience. Text links were blue and underlined. When you hover over a text link, the underline is removed.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xh8GeEhUWiOa9_bVK3bC95T0oa9aNkYwCNSWXt9Pk5OoVXmyEorXvW3GRcbtQm__L-YdPfMPegpPmJKLeiFG0s7F4uaA1-Pp0C3Bu_y9f77MuY9pEwjoFvNSchDilGSKQ_MUbXY" alt=""></p>

    <h2><a id="Spacing_units_76"></a>Spacing units</h2>
    <p>We used larger spacing units to delineate sections of content or controls. Smaller spacing units were used to space the elements that made up each section of content or cluster of controls. For example, the padding around the container of a view was made larger the margins between an input and its label. To keep consistent padding and margins on elements throughout our application, we used the spacing units of 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, ad 40px. All of those units are multiples of 8. This helped us maintain consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm throughout all of the components that made up the Jostle UI.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YZdZKj7Kq_WY4p6RlwhCUQEjnO5e7gfkyYM7u-f3u4umfSnjNeMdf90v8Pk4U1O6-nH4bNiTpikVyNIL_BLJ_80Ab5MTiw6Zui4afl2YQ600o8H3Mt0v1uNF25EcBwlBfrLT0qE" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Borders_83"></a>Borders</h2>
    <p>We considered it best practice to try and build hierarchy within a view <em>without borders</em> but they could be used to delineate content blocks and sets of actions if needed. Most of our borders had a border-width of 1px. Our Fat-light border was 5px wide and was used sparingly to bring hierarchy into a view.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UIv7ij01tMlNL4XRqVu5bmpaLuLgM8zkvlFNhII2S2a65G-gYh6WCOn0MWqqtAGtHJSVA8hT0eiZY2wNJyvlIh2r8u1WaerxBXCkUIepyMdkELdmdIP3ZkJIIVhxcpEEWbyR5x4" alt=""></p>
    <p>From left-to-right through sub-sections within a Primary View, lighter and darker shades of grey were applied to fills and borders to indicate related groups of content.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Lg6T62qMZlHJ_UtyLDFRZ4SLzMtnW5p44S5xA1hAjRixwN1kCX8059gzSkCZZyqvrGD9vAeJKtJzxjo8Ev7ysgGhgjhsWGxcKLyXmJn1NFntrfJSE9dZRfDYfSQ_zXVOgutR5VU" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Buttons_95"></a>Buttons</h2>
    <p>We had 3 classes of buttons: Neutral, Destructive, and Confirm. Each class of button could be disabled. The hover and active states for each class stepped 1 colour darker in the palette. When moving through a form using keyboard navigation, we applied a 2px border with the darker colour in the pallet to indicate highlight. All buttons had a border-radius of 4px.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gIMydHyrcSTSuSP-IXEKsl3O81MLstJ2nvcvI-YFCvVSfb-BN2yOylula1ejjx_rBZnCh7s5JBpdbMrhBTS9j4lghIXCpBq1w0YhiX3Xam8byQkekhEt6Y_BbVmSckNBJTz9bZo" alt=""></p>
    <p>The size of buttons and input elements was determined by the font-size, line-height, and padding of text within a given button. For most of our buttons we used ‚Äúfont-size: 14px/22px; font-weight: 700; padding: 8px 16px;‚Äù.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nw5qMtAFRCDIPtW0q_f8fdOW2JZ4rM7LHBzzgjGkj6Vv06j6WhwvYulDxCCoHqdwZu1Ceg8AvfxR01KPbOyH6HBnAE8i6DxZ5gyYPMqo7ASlYXE-a7HwwP271wNNE_1n_7PN3qo" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Inputs_108"></a>Inputs</h2>
    <p>Inputs were also proportionally sized by the font-size and padding within the input. We also used ‚Äúfont-size 14px/22px; padding 8px 16px;‚Äù for inputs. All inputs had a solid, 1px, grey02(#ccc) border, and corners were rounded with a border-radius of 4px. We labelled all of our inputs top-left using a bold 14px font. Placeholder text was expected to direct the user by example and was coloured grey03 (#9ba3a5). Some data required a character limit so a counter was placed above the top-right corner of the input.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I4ytOMaDO7kQGamW07wjYypIhi-5h2Yj594TPMom4dxebdLD-TJUZ44tyAOVx5zxKSbSgraRhg1d2HtPmqT1JAnMB2L_lqTPvg_GyyBHKqrztU7gJu44_NgFmLTsF14vJDDktxY" alt=""></p>
    <p><strong>Focused inputs</strong> were painted with a blue 2px stroke width. <strong>Disabled inputs</strong> had a background-colour grey01(#ebebeb) and the CSS attribute ‚Äúcursor: not-allowed‚Äú.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OyN9sqGIwQBD3BZyn9XX-7UREAFhZ-O8jP0OcGKzh4I5jH5T20HwGfrmztIAciiOjh-dIRwYFICfjulTHFCOxzJfsqIjKocRHujr5yDUnkl88eW1H1oAwbhZO8JWufzxVNTnId4" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Icons_121"></a>Icons</h2>
    <p>When I started at Jostle, there was a broad range of icon styles, varying in size, fill, and stroke. They felt disconnected and considered for each view that was being tacked on to the application. The icon set had the same problem as the colours and font-sizing‚Äîa plethora of values that made for a feeling of disconnect and weak feeling throughout the product. Grey Vaisius made the initial push on the icon set, redrawing the majority of the existing icons in the application. He established the size and general art direction for the set. Over the years, I‚Äôve helped with tweaking many icons so they fit together better as a set as well as drawing new icons for features that have been added to the platform.</p>
    <p>General constraints for drawing icons are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>For the most part, icons should have square corners and stroke terminals.</li>
    <li>Icons used in app UI are drawn on a 17px x 17px frame.</li>
    <li>When applied to UI, icons should be horizontally and vertically centred within a 40px x 40px container to provide adequate affordance for interaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_3579122CE10EDD8805147178FCEB8448541A4C0CA8C54D80148E52B25F55C030_1549256874610_UI+Icons.png" alt=""></p>
    <h2><a id="Why_didnt_we_included_components_137"></a>Why didn‚Äôt we included ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù?</h2>
    <p>You may be wondering, why did we stop describing things at the atomic level? The Design Team discussed building a ‚Äúliving style guide‚Äù or fully detailing components we used throughout the application. I could be argued that we already provided some component level styling. After several rounds of debate, we agreed not to take on that task for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Having a detailed component based library like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Pure CSS, would not in and of itself guarantee a polished user experience.</li>
    <li>Too much detailed explanation was required to describe the molecular structures that comprised our common views.</li>
    <li>The Style Guide was more of a system for design and was not fully integrated into the application. That meant that the more detail we added, the higher the likelihood the guide would become outdated and require maintenance.</li>
    <li>Designers and Developers need to work together to define components to ensure there is adoption, effective implementation, and a shared need for maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Figma_Jekyll_Gitlabs_and_stylejostleus_146"></a>Figma, Jekyll, Gitlabs, and <a href="http://style.jostle.us">style.jostle.us</a></h2>
    <p>We translated the Style Guide into a shared Team Library for designing with in Figma. We built a website using Jekyll and deployed it to <a href="http://style.jostle.us/">style.jostle.us</a>. Unfortunately, this URL is only accessible while on Jostle‚Äôs VPN but I‚Äôve got a backup of the site on <a href="https://github.com/justinalm/jostle-styleguide">my personal Github</a>. This website has proven to be a great asset for both our Design and Dev Teams. Making our styles real in HTML and CSS made our design system ‚Äúreal‚Äù because it shared the same material as our product in production. We used git for version control and collaborated on the project over Jostle‚Äôs Gitlabs. This shared resource on the web was strong evidence to our Dev Team that our design intent in Figma could be fully realized in the browser.</p>

    <h2><a id="Conclusion_157"></a>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As Jostle applied a lean development philosophy, the Style Guide wasn‚Äôt used to go back and fix everything that was stylistically flawed. Instead, as we moved forward, all the product we shipped was expected to hold true to the system we designed. Although the full impact of the design system within the Style Guide is yet to be realized throughout all of the Jostle platform, it brought near immediate benefits to the Design Team. We were able to move forward in a unified voice‚Äîcommunicating a shared vision for the product together.</p>
