## Experience

### Interface Designer – [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com)
**_Dec. 2012 — Present_**

As an interface designer at Steamclock Software, my work involves strategy, information architecture, wire-framing, visual design of user interface, and the design and production of marketing material of various formats. Half of my time at Steamclock is spent designing the products [WeddingDJ](http://www.steamclock.com/weddingdj/) and [PartyMonster](http://www.steamclock.com/partymonster/). The other half of my time is spent on [consulting and design](http://www.steamclock.com/services/).

### Contract Designer – [Free Agency Creative](http://freeagencycreative.com/)
**_Aug. 2012 – Nov. 2012_**

I handled design and production of point of purchase displays and materials for [Nintendo of America](http://www.nintendo.com/), large scale in-mall and direct mail marketing campaigns for [Park Royal Shopping Centre](http://www.shopparkroyal.com/), advertising, signage, video and marketing collateral for some of Vancouver’s most successful real estate developers, and print and digital collateral for [Marketplace Events](http://www.nintendo.com/) – a company that produces some of the largest and longest-running home show events in North America.

### Interaction Designer – [Emily Carr University of Art & Design](http://www.ecuad.ca)
**_Feb. 2012 — Apr. 2012_**

I designed the website for The [2012 Emily Carr University Graduation Exhibition Catalogue](http://grad2012.ecuad.ca/) and directed the deployment of the site to Emily Carr’s server. Working with a team of students handing the identity of the exhibition, I presented concepts, prototypes, development of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP, throughout the design and production of the catalogue website. The website was designed to make student work easily accessible on any device and major browsers.

**Testimonial**

_“Justin Alm is one of those rare web designers who is just as concerned with the functionality of a website as he is with it’s form, and has the talents and experience to fully deliver both. He is able to produce innovative web design while working within the project’s limitations and deadlines. He is a delight to work with, and I hope to one day be fortunate enough to work with him again.”_

During my research assistantship with the [Social + Interactive Media](http://research.ecuad.ca/simcentre/) and [Stereoscopic 3D Centres](http://research.ecuad.ca/s3dcentre/) at Emily Carr University of Art + Design, I conducted interviews, produced graphics for feature articles, designed motion graphics for promotional and instructional videos, and published content using Drupal to their respective websites.

### Interaction Designer – [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)
**_Mar. — Sept. 2011_**

I was one of a team of Emily Carr faculty and students who investigated technology options for creating an ebook, [Learning, Freedom and the Web](http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/). We built an ebook for tablets, and desktop computers, and that is distributed for free. We designed it to take advantage of the navigation and multimedia opportunities a tablet could provide. Working with Vancouver-based development company Steamclock Software, our team recommended building the book in HTML5, Javascript and CSS.

## Education

### Emily Carr University of Art & Design – B.Des — Interaction Design
**_2008 — 2012_**

The [Interaction Design Degree Program](http://design.ecuad.ca/) has taught me the iterative process of design. From writing proposals, concept development, visual research and exploration, user-testing, refining designs and development, and finishing projects for implementation or delivery, I’ve been educated to embrace the tension found in the convergent and divergent plot structure we find in the narrative of every design project.

_Activities and Societies: [WOO Student Publication](http://www.woopublication.ca/), [Graduation Exhibition Catalogue 2012](http://grad2012.ecuad.ca), [SIM Centre](http://research.ecuad.ca/simcentre/), [S3D Centre](http://research.ecuad.ca/s3dcentre/)._

### University of Saskatchewan – B.Arts — History
**_2000 — 2004_**

The primary focus of my studies was [The History of the Cold War and Conflict Studies](http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/humanities-finearts.php). My learning ranged from the history of Europe in the 19th and 20th Centuries, history of imperialism, and the history of development.
